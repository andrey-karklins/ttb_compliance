## How to use this guideline (LLM/QA workflow)

Use it as a **checklist** against a proposed label. For each label element below:

- **Find the label element** on the front/back labels (or other panels).
- **Verify required wording and format** (units, abbreviations, placement, and any required qualifiers).
- **Record pass/fail** and any corrective action.

This document is organized to support a step-by-step compliance review:

- **Mandatory information on a label** (required for most distilled spirits labels)
- **Mandatory information that is conditional** (applies only if certain features apply, or for imports)
- **Optional label information** (allowed with conditions; may trigger additional requirements)

## Definitions and label anatomy (distilled spirits)

- **Anatomy of a Distilled Spirits Label (tool/page)**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2547`
- **What TTB considers a “label” / label information**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2544`

### Extracted guidance (from Anatomy tool page)

The Anatomy tool provides **TTB tips and format/placement rules** for common label elements.

#### Cross-cutting placement rule (same “field of vision”)

TTB’s Anatomy guidance states that **Brand Name**, **Class/Type Designation**, and **Alcohol Content** must appear in the **same field of vision**; these elements may appear on the **front, back, or side** of the container.

From TTB’s “Mandatory Label Information” page, **same field of vision** means:

- A **single side** of a container where all required items can be viewed **simultaneously** without turning the container.
- For a **cylindrical** container, a “side” is **40% of the circumference**.

The label bearing the brand name, alcohol content, and class/type/other designation:

- May appear on the **front, back, or side** of the container.
- **Does not** need to be the label that faces the consumer in a retail display.

#### Brand name (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **Definition**: “The brand name is the name under which a distilled spirits product or line of distilled spirits products are sold.”
- **Placement**: may appear on **any** label.
- **Key format/quality checks**
  - Must be in the **same field of vision** with alcohol content and class/type designation.
  - Must not mislead about **age, origin, identity, or other characteristics**.
  - A **class/type designation standing alone** (e.g., “Vodka”) may **not** be used as the brand name.
  - If no other brand name appears, **the bottler/packer/importer name is treated as the brand name**.

#### Class/type designation (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **Core requirement**: distilled spirits must be labeled with the **class and/or type** (e.g., “Vodka”), in accordance with a **standard of identity**.
- **Specialty products**: products that do not fit a standard of identity are “**distilled spirits specialty**” and must be designated in accordance with **trade and consumer understanding**, or (if none) with a **distinctive or fanciful name**; together with a **statement of composition**, these act as the label designation.
- **Placement & consistency**
  - Must appear **separate and apart** from additional information.
  - Must be in the **same field of vision** with alcohol content and brand name.
  - If it appears more than once, ensure the designation is **consistent** wherever it appears.

#### Alcohol content (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **Mandatory form**: a numerical indication stated in **percent alcohol by volume**.
- **Optional add-on**: the label **may also** state alcohol content in **degrees of proof** if it appears in the **same field of vision** as the percent alcohol by volume statement.
- **If both are shown**: the proof statement should be **distinguished** from the percent statement (e.g., **parentheses** or **brackets**) to emphasize both expressions mean the same thing.
- **Acceptable examples (from the Anatomy tool)**
  - `Alcohol ___% by volume`
  - `___% Alc. By Vol.`
- **Not allowed (from the Anatomy tool)**: `ABV` is **not** allowed as an abbreviation of “alcohol by volume” in the **mandatory** alcohol content statement.

#### Health warning statement (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **Applicability**: required by law for alcohol beverages bottled/imported for U.S. sale that contain **not less than 0.5% ABV**.
- **Exactness**: must appear **exactly** as in the regulations.
- **Format notes (from the Anatomy tool)**
  - “GOVERNMENT WARNING” must be **capital letters** and **bold type**.
  - The **remainder** of the warning statement **may not** appear in bold type.
  - Must be **separate and apart** from surrounding text.
  - Ensure spelling and punctuation match the regulations.
  - **Other countries’ alcohol health warnings** (text or pictorial) **may not appear** on the label.

#### Name and address (domestic) (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **Mandatory**: name and address (**city and state**) of the bottler, distiller, processor (rectifier), or importer.
- **Placement**: may appear on any label, or may be **blown/embossed/molded** into the container as part of manufacturing.
- **Identity match**: name (or trade name) and address must be **identical** to what appears on the basic permit.
- **Separation**: do not add words within the name/address statement (must appear **separate and apart**), except for additional optional phrases authorized in regulations.

#### Net contents (what the Anatomy tool says)

- **What it is**: indicates the **volume** of distilled spirits in the container.
- **Placement**: may appear on any label, or may be **blown/embossed/molded** into the container.
- **Format notes (from the Anatomy tool)**
  - Use acceptable abbreviations (examples given: `750 mL`, `1 L`).
  - Ensure the container is an approved **standard of fill**.

## Mandatory information on a label (distilled spirits)

This section covers the label statements that are **required on most distilled spirits labels**.

### 1) Brand name (mandatory)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2543`
- **Definition (TTB)**: “A brand name is the name under which distilled spirits products, or a line of distilled spirits products, are sold.”
- **If no brand name is used**: the name of the **bottler, distiller, or importer** will be treated as the brand name.
- **Placement**
  - Must appear in the **same field of vision** with **alcohol content** and **class/type designation** (which may appear on the front, back, or side).
- **Formatting requirements**
  - **Type size (minimum)**
    - **2 mm** for containers **larger than 200 mL**
    - **1 mm** for containers **200 mL or less**
    - Applies to **each numeral or letter**, including uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - **Legibility**
    - Must be readily legible under ordinary conditions
    - Must appear on a **contrasting background**
    - Must appear **separate and apart** from, or be **substantially more conspicuous** than, descriptive/explanatory information
- **Non-misleading standard**
  - A brand name is misleading if it creates a misleading/erroneous impression (alone or with other material) as to the **age, origin, identity, or other characteristics** of the distilled spirit.
  - In some cases, TTB notes that qualifying with the word **“brand”** may be appropriate to avoid an erroneous impression (case-by-case).

### 2) Class or type designation (mandatory)

- **Master page reference**: the master page links to the Distilled Spirits BAM (PDF) for standards of identity.
- **PDF is skipped in this HTML-only build.**
- **What to check**
  - Label includes the appropriate **class/type** statement describing the kind of distilled spirit (per TTB standards of identity)

**Additional TTB clarification (from the Brand Name page and Anatomy tool)**:

- A distinctive or fanciful name **is not a substitute** for a class/type designation, or for a statement of composition if one is required.
- For **distilled spirits specialty** products, TTB describes the designation as the combination of:
  - a distinctive or fanciful name (when required), and
  - a **truthful and adequate statement of composition** (e.g., `Rum with natural flavors added`),
  acting together as the designation on the label.

### 3) Alcohol content statement (mandatory)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2545`
- **Core requirement**: a numerical statement indicating alcohol content in terms of **percent alcohol by volume** (required on all distilled spirits products).
- **Special case (solid material in container)**:
  - Products that contain a significant amount of solid material (example given: a liqueur with whole cherries) must state alcohol content (determined at time of bottling) as:
    - `Bottled at_____ percent alcohol by volume.`
- **Placement**
  - Must appear in the **same field of vision** as the **brand name** and **class/type/other designation**.
- **Formatting requirements (percent alcohol by volume statement)**
  - **Units/wording**
    - Percentages must be stated as **percentage of alcohol by volume**.
    - Only `alc.` and `vol.` may abbreviate “alcohol” and “volume” (with or without periods).
    - `ABV` is **not allowed**.
    - “Alcohol/alc.” and “by volume/by vol.” may be uppercase or lowercase.
    - The numeric value may precede or follow “alcohol/alc.”
  - **Examples (TTB)**
    - `ALCOHOL ___% BY VOLUME`
    - `___% Alc. by Vol.`
  - **Type size (minimum)**
    - **2 mm** if container capacity is **larger than 200 mL**
    - **1 mm** if container capacity is **200 mL or less**
  - **Legibility**
    - Readily legible under ordinary conditions
    - On a **contrasting background**
    - **Separate and apart** from, or **substantially more conspicuous** than, descriptive/explanatory information
- **Tolerance (TTB)**: actual alcohol content may vary by **±0.3 percentage points** from the labeled value.

### 4) Net contents (mandatory)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2539`
- **Core requirement**: indicates the volume of distilled spirits in the container, expressed in **liters** and **milliliters**.
  - “liter” may be spelled `liter` or `litre`, or abbreviated as `L`.
  - “milliliters” may be abbreviated as `ml.`, `mL.`, or `ML.`
- **Placement**
  - May appear on **any** label (front, back, or side), or may be **blown/embossed/molded** into the container.
- **Formatting requirements**
  - If a **standard of fill** is prescribed (27 CFR 5.203), net contents must be stated in the manner and form set out in that regulation.
  - **Type size (minimum)**
    - **2 mm** for containers larger than **200 mL**
    - **1 mm** for containers **200 mL or less**
    - Applies to each numeral/letter (upper or lower case).
  - **Legibility/presentation**
    - Must generally appear **parallel to the base** of the container (or be otherwise equally conspicuous)
    - Must be readily legible, on a **contrasting background**
    - Must be **separate and apart** from, or **substantially more conspicuous** than, descriptive/explanatory information
- **TTB tolerances (summary from page)**: tolerances may be allowed for discrepancies due to:
  - Good commercial practice measuring/filling errors,
  - Unavoidable container capacity manufacturing variation (with limits for designs that cannot be uniform),
  - Atmospheric condition differences leading to ordinary evaporation exposure (case-by-case reasonableness).
- **Standard distilled spirits containers (anti-misleading container rules)**
  - Unless approved by TTB as a **distinctive liquor container**, TTB indicates purchasers are misled when:
    - **Headspace** exceeds **8%** of total capacity (containers **200 mL or more**) after closure, or
    - Container **design** makes it appear to hold substantially more than its actual capacity (even if net contents statement is correct).
- **Authorized standards of fill (from TTB page)**
  - **Bottles/containers (non-can)**: `1.8 L`, `1.75 L`, `1 L`, `900 mL`, `750 mL`, `720 mL`, `700 mL`, `500 mL` (authorized for bottling until June 30, 1989), `375 mL`, `200 mL`, `100 mL`, `50 mL`
  - **Cans** (metal can-shaped, integral closure, not readily reclosed): `355 mL`, `200 mL`, `100 mL`, `50 mL`
- **Optional U.S. equivalent measurement**
  - Allowed **in addition to** the metric statement, but must appear in the **same field of vision** as the metric net contents statement.

### 5) Name and address (mandatory)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2540`
- **What the statement is (TTB)**: provides the name and address of the **importer** or the **bottler** of the distilled spirits, as applicable.
- **Domestic distilled spirits (TTB examples and phrasing concepts)**
  - When bottled by/for the distiller or processor (rectifier), the label may use:
    - an operational phrase like `distilled by` (or other applicable phrase for the operation), followed by
    - the name/trade name under which the spirits were distilled/rectified (or any trade name shown on the basic permit).
  - Common bottling phrasing example shown: `Bottled By: <Name> <City>, <State>`
- **Imported distilled spirits (TTB)**
  - Generally consists of importer name + address of importer’s principal place of business (as shown on the basic permit),
    preceded by `Imported by` or a similar phrase such as `Sole Agent` / `Sole U.S Agent`.
  - If imported spirits are bottled/packed/filled **after importation**:
    - label must show bottler/packer/filler name and address preceded by an explanatory phrase (e.g., `Bottled by`), **or**
    - if bottled by/for the person responsible for importation, the importer name/address may appear with a phrase such as
      `imported by and bottled in the United States for` or `imported and bottled by`.
- **Placement**: may appear on **any** label on the container.
- **Formatting requirements**
  - **Type size (minimum)**
    - **2 mm** for containers larger than **200 mL**

- **Name rules (TTB)**: the name (or trade name) of any permittee on any label must be **identical** to the name on the basic permit.
- **Address rules (TTB)**
  - **City and state are required**; street address and zip code may be omitted.
  - For a bottler/other spirits premises: address is the place where the operation occurred (post office address on the basic permit or other qualifying document).
  - Label may show the proprietor’s **principal place of business** instead of the operation location **if** the operation location is indicated by printing/coding/other markings on the label or bottle.
  - For an importer: address is the city/state of the importer’s principal U.S. place of business (as on the basic permit).

### 6) Health warning statement (mandatory)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2542`
- **Required statement text (TTB page transcription)**

The health warning statement required by ABLA is:

> **GOVERNMENT WARNING:** (1) According to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and may cause health problems.

- **Applicability (TTB)**: must appear on all alcohol beverages for sale/distribution in the U.S. containing **not less than 0.5% ABV** (including certain Armed Forces contexts).
- **Placement**: may appear on a **front**, **back**, or **side** label.
- **Formatting requirements**
  - Must appear **separate and apart** from all other information.
  - The words `GOVERNMENT WARNING` must be **capital letters** and **bold type**; the remainder **may not** appear in bold.

## Mandatory information (conditional / when applicable)

### A) Age statement (conditional)

- **Master page reference**: linked from master page as BAM Chapter 8 (PDF).
- **PDF is skipped in this HTML-only build.**
- **What to check**
  - If an age statement appears, ensure it is compliant (exact rules not captured here due to PDF-only source).

### B) Color ingredient disclosures (conditional)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2541`
- **When this applies**
  - When color ingredients/color additives are used and disclosures are required (per TTB page)
- **What to check**
  - Whether a coloring material is permitted for the class/type (per standards of identity) and whether its presence triggers disclosure
  - Whether any of the **specifically-named color additives** are present (below)
  - Required wording and formatting for the disclosure statement(s)

**Key distilled spirits labeling points (from TTB page)**:

- Many distilled spirits contain **color additives** added to impart color not natural to the product.
- For certain classes/types, standards of identity may permit coloring materials (e.g., caramel); otherwise, addition of color may alter the class/type designation (coloring materials are not permissible in every class/type).

#### Specific disclosures required for certain color additives

TTB states that **three color additives must be specifically named** on distilled spirits labels **if present**:

- `FD&C Yellow No. 5` (or `FD&C Yellow #5`)
- `cochineal extract`
- `carmine`

For these, the phrase must appear:

- `Contains [color additive name]`

#### Placement/interaction with statement of composition (TTB)

- **FD&C Yellow No. 5**
  - If a statement of composition is required, it may use `certified color` rather than naming Yellow No. 5 there,
    but `FD&C Yellow No. 5` (or `FD&C Yellow #5`) must still be specifically declared **elsewhere on the label**.
- **Cochineal extract and/or carmine**
  - If a statement of composition is required, it may use `artificial color` rather than naming these there,
    but `cochineal extract` and/or `carmine` must still be specifically declared **elsewhere on the label**.

#### Formatting requirements (TTB)

- **Type size (minimum)**
  - **2 mm** for containers larger than **200 mL**
  - **1 mm** for containers **200 mL or less**
  - Applies to each numeral/letter (upper or lower case).
- **Legibility**
  - Readily legible under ordinary conditions
  - On a **contrasting background**
  - **Separate and apart** from, or **substantially more conspicuous** than, descriptive/explanatory information

### C) Commodity statement (conditional)

- **Master page reference**: linked as a PDF (`commodity-statement.pdf`).
- **PDF is skipped in this HTML-only build.**
- **What to check**
  - If applicable, confirm whether a commodity statement is required and whether your label contains it.

### D) Country of origin marking (imports only)

- **External reference from master page (CBP)**: `https://www.cbp.gov/trade/rulings/informed-compliance-publications/marking-country-origin-us-imports`
- **What to check**
  - Imported distilled spirits should include country of origin marking consistent with U.S. import marking rules.

**Core marking rule (from CBP page)**:

- Every article of foreign origin entering the U.S. must be **legibly marked** with the **English name** of the country of origin (unless an exception applies).

**What to check on imported distilled spirits containers (container-marking basics)**:

- **Text content**: country name in English (avoid ambiguous “E.U.”/“E.C.” style abbreviations; CBP notes those are not acceptable as “country” names).
- **Legibility**: mark must be readable by a person of normal vision (adequate size and clarity).
- **Conspicuous location**:
  - must be in a place where it can be seen with **casual handling**,
  - must not be covered or concealed by subsequent attachments/additions,
  - must be visible without disassembling the item or removing/changing position of parts.
- **Permanence**: as indelible and permanent as the nature of the product permits; should remain during handling unless deliberately removed.
- **If another locality appears and could mislead**:
  - if the name of any locality other than the actual country of manufacture appears and may mislead/deceive, CBP notes that `made in (country)` (or similar words) must appear in **close proximity** to, and in **comparable size letters** as, the other locality.

**Methods (CBP examples)**:

- Best: marking that becomes part of the article (branding, stenciling, stamping, printing, molding, etc.).
- Tags can be acceptable if attached conspicuously and remain until ultimate purchaser unless deliberately removed.
- Adhesive labels may be used in some instances, but CBP notes they are not recommended if they may come loose.

## Optional distilled spirits label information

This section covers **commonly used optional statements** and other optional categories. Optional statements must still be truthful, non-misleading, and may be regulated/limited by TTB.

### 1) Distinctive or fanciful name (optional for many; mandatory for specialty products)

- **Dedicated TTB page/anchor**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2543#fanciful`
- **TTB explanation (from the Brand Name page)**
  - A distinctive or fanciful name is a **descriptive name or phrase** chosen to further identify a product and may be used **in addition to** a brand name.
  - It may be required for **distilled spirits specialties** and may appear on other products as **additional information**.
  - Like other optional information, it **may not create a false or misleading impression** about the distilled spirit.
- **Not a substitute (TTB note)**
  - If you use a distinctive/fanciful name, it is **not** a substitute for:
    - a **brand name**,
    - a **class/type designation**, or
    - a **statement of composition** (if required).
- **Specialty product pattern (TTB example concept)**
  - For a specialty product, the **fanciful name** plus the **statement of composition** can serve as the designation (e.g., fanciful name like `SPICED RUM` paired with a statement of composition like `RUM WITH SPICES ADDED`).

### 2) Alcohol content expressed as degrees of proof (optional add-on)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2545`
- **What to check**
  - Proof may appear **in addition to** the mandatory percent alcohol by volume statement.
  - Proof must appear in the **same field of vision** as the percent alcohol by volume statement.
  - When both are shown, the proof statement must be placed in **parentheses** or **brackets**, or otherwise **distinguished** from the mandatory percent statement.

### 3) Gluten content statements (optional)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2474`
- **Source**: TTB Ruling 2020-2 (Gluten Content Statements in labeling/advertising for wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages).
- **High-level rule**: gluten-related statements must be **truthful, accurate, and non-misleading**. TTB treats gluten content statements as **health-related statements** and evaluates them case-by-case.

#### Allowed “gluten-free” (and similar) claims

TTB states that `gluten-free` (and similar claims such as `no gluten`, `free of gluten`, `without gluten`) may be used **only when** the product would be entitled to make a “gluten-free” claim under FDA’s definition (referenced by TTB in this ruling).

For distilled spirits, TTB explains it will permit `gluten-free` claims for **distilled spirits distilled from gluten-containing grains** as long as **good manufacturing practices** are followed that prevent introduction of any gluten-containing material into the **final product** (and industry members should be prepared to substantiate this upon request).

#### “Processed/Treated/Crafted to remove gluten” statements (conditional)

TTB allows the statement:

- `[Processed or Treated or Crafted] to remove gluten`

**only under specific conditions**, including a required qualifying statement that must appear **legibly and conspicuously** and as part of (immediately adjacent to, or a continuation of) the above statement:

> `Product fermented from grains containing gluten and [processed or treated or crafted] to remove gluten. The gluten content of this product cannot be verified, and this product may contain gluten.`

#### What to check (label review)

- If the label uses any gluten-related claim:
  - Confirm it is one of the claim types TTB allows under this ruling and that the required conditions (including any required qualifying statement text/placement) are met.
  - Avoid implying a specific gluten level for fermented products without an appropriate basis/qualification (TTB flags certain specific-level statements as potentially misleading pending validated methods).

### 4) Major food allergen labeling (optional)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/868`
- **What the TTB HTML page provides**
  - TTB describes an interim rule (effective July 26, 2006) that allows **voluntary** labeling of major food allergens on labels of wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages.
  - Under the interim approach described on the page, industry members **may** voluntarily declare the presence of certain allergens (but are **not required** to do so), and if they choose to do so there are mandatory rules for how to undertake such labeling.
- **Major food allergens listed on the page**
  - milk, eggs, fish, Crustacean shellfish, tree nuts, wheat, peanuts, soybeans
  - plus ingredients that contain protein derived from these foods

**Note (HTML-only build limitation)**: the detailed formatting/wording rules appear to be contained in linked Federal Register PDFs, which are skipped here. If you need allergen statement exact formatting rules in this guideline, we’ll need an HTML source for them.

### 5) Statements related to nutrient content (optional category)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/2288`
- Related FAQs (anchors on TTB FAQ page):
  - Serving Facts: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#sf`
  - Alcohol Facts: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#af`
  - Sugar content: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#sug`

**Key labeling principle (from TTB “Alcohol Beverage Labeling” page)**:

- TTB regulations **do not require** nutrient content labeling for alcohol beverages.
- TTB allows truthful, accurate, and specific calorie/carbohydrate statements, but considers them **misleading unless** they include a statement listing **per serving**:
  - number of **calories**, and
  - grams of **carbohydrates**, **protein**, and **fat**.
- TTB describes two formats for these voluntary nutrient-related statements:
  - a **statement of average analysis**, and
  - a **Serving Facts** statement,
  and notes the **serving size may differ** depending on the format.
- TTB also provides guidance about **Alcohol Facts** statements (per-serving alcohol content information without nutrient content statements).

**Note (HTML-only build limitation)**: the detailed format templates are largely referenced via linked PDFs (TTB rulings), which are skipped here. We will extract label-format details from the linked **HTML FAQs** and other HTML guidance pages next (breadth-first).

#### Caloric and carbohydrate representations (from TTB Ruling 2004-1 FAQs page)

The Ruling 2004-1 FAQ page adds label/claim constraints that are checkable without the PDF:

- **Standard serving size used for certain determinations (TTB)**:
  - Malt beverages: **12 fl. oz.**
  - Wine: **5 fl. oz.**
  - Distilled spirits: **1.5 fl. oz.** (used regardless of proof for the narrow purposes described in the FAQ)
- **“Low carbohydrate” / “low carb” claims (TTB)**:
  - TTB will approve `low carbohydrate` / `low carb` where a **statement of average analysis** is present and the product contains **no more than 7 grams of carbohydrates** per **standard serving size**.
- **“Reduced/lower carbohydrate” comparative claims (TTB)**:
  - Allowed (with a statement of average analysis present) when used as part of a statement that:
    - specifies carbohydrates per **serving size**, and
    - compares that number to the carbohydrates in another specified product you produce.
- **Abbreviated references on the brand label (TTB)**:
  - Truthful, non-misleading abbreviated references like `3.2 carbs` may be used **in addition to**, but not **in lieu of**, a statement of average analysis, and must be consistent with the statement of average analysis elsewhere on the label.

#### Expression rules and tolerances for nutrient statements (TTB Procedure 2020-1)

TTB Procedure 2020-1 describes how TTB tests and evaluates voluntary calorie/fat/carbohydrate/protein content claims and provides checkable expression rules and tolerances:

- **Expression/rounding rules (per serving)**
  - **Calories**: express to nearest calorie; amounts < 5 calories may be expressed as `0`.
  - **Fat**: grams of total fat per serving
    - nearest **0.5 g** increment below 5 g
    - nearest **1 g** increment above 5 g
    - if < 0.5 g, may be expressed as `0`.
  - **Carbohydrate**: grams total carbohydrates per serving
    - nearest **0.1 g**
    - if < 1 g, may state `Contains less than 1 gram` / `less than 1 gram`
    - if < 0.5 g, may be expressed as `0`.
  - **Protein**: grams protein per serving
    - nearest **0.1 g**
    - if < 1 g, may state `Contains less than 1 gram` / `less than 1 gram`
    - if < 0.5 g, may be expressed as `0`.
- **Tolerance levels (TTB acceptance policy)**
  - **Calories**: acceptable if not more than **20% above** labeled/advertised amount.
  - **Carbohydrates and fat**: each acceptable if not more than **20% above** labeled/advertised amount.
  - **Protein**: acceptable if not more than **20% below** labeled/advertised amount.

#### Serving Facts statements (TTB Alcohol FAQs: SF1–SF20)

- **Source (TTB)**: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#sf`

TTB’s Alcohol FAQs provide detailed, compliance-checkable rules for **optional Serving Facts statements** (labels and advertisements):

- **Optional vs required (TTB)**:
  - Serving Facts statements are **optional**.
  - If you make calorie or carbohydrate claims/representations, TTB will view the label/advertisement as misleading unless it includes either:
    - a **statement of average analysis** (TTB Ruling 2004-1), or
    - a **Serving Facts** statement that complies with TTB’s Serving Facts guidance.
- **What a Serving Facts statement includes (TTB definition)**:
  - serving size,
  - number of servings per container,
  - calories per serving,
  - grams of carbohydrates, protein, and fat per serving,
  - optional: alcohol content information (ABV; and optionally fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving, rounded to the nearest tenth, if ABV is included).
- **Per serving vs per container (TTB)**:
  - May be stated per **container** only if the container is **equal to or less than a single serving size**.
  - Otherwise must be stated per **serving size** and must specify serving size as part of the statement.
  - Dual-column formats (per serving and per container) are described as an option.
- **Serving sizes for Serving Facts (TTB chart; distilled spirits-specific)**
  - Serving size is based on **alcohol percent by volume** (ABV category) and product type.
  - For **distilled spirits**:
    - **Above 24% ABV**: `1.5 fl oz (44 ml)`, or `50 ml` for 50 ml containers
    - **Above 16% to 24% ABV**: `2.5 fl oz (74 ml)`
    - **Above 7% to 16% ABV**: `5 fl oz (148 ml)`
  - Servings per container should be **rounded to the nearest quarter serving**.
- **Placement on container (TTB)**:
  - May appear on any label, including a strip/neck label.
  - Note: for products where ABV is mandatory on the brand label (including distilled spirits), an optional ABV shown within Serving Facts on another label does **not** remove the obligation to place the mandatory alcohol content statement on the brand label.
- **Presentation (TTB)**:
  - Panel or linear displays are described as acceptable options.
  - No specific type size or font requirements are stated for Serving Facts, but it should be on a contrasting background and readily legible under ordinary circumstances.
- **Allowed abbreviations for Serving Facts (TTB list; may be used with or without periods)**:
  - `Alc/vol` or `Alc by vol` (for “Alcohol by volume”)
  - `fl oz` (U.S. fluid ounces)
  - `Cal` (calories)
  - `g` (grams)
  - `Carb` (carbohydrate)
  - `Serv` (serving) — except in the title `Serving Facts`
  - `ml` (milliliter)
  - `Amt.` (amount)

#### Sugar content statements (TTB Alcohol FAQs: SUG1–SUG5)

- **Source (TTB)**: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#sug`

TTB treats sugar statements as a type of **carbohydrate** representation and allows them on labels/advertisements under specific conditions:

- **Numerical sugar statements (grams per serving)**
  - Truthful, accurate, and non-misleading numerical statements about sugar content are permitted.
  - Because sugar is a carbohydrate, a numerical sugar statement may appear only if the label/advertisement also bears either:
    - a **statement of average analysis**, or
    - a **Serving Facts** statement,
    and the **serving size** used for the sugar statement is consistent with the applicable serving size guidance.
- **How to express sugar grams per serving (TTB guidance referencing carbohydrate expression rules)**
  - Express grams of sugar per serving to the **nearest tenth of a gram**.
  - If a serving contains **less than 1 gram**, you may use `Contains less than 1 gram (g)` or `less than 1 gram (g)`.
  - If a serving contains **less than 0.5 g**, sugar content may be expressed as `0` grams (g).
- **“Zero Sugar” / “No Sugar” / “Sugar Free” claims**
  - Permitted if the product contains **less than 0.5 g of sugar per serving**.
  - Such claims must still be accompanied by either a statement of average analysis or a Serving Facts statement, and use the applicable serving size guidance.
- **What “sugars” means (TTB definition for this guidance)**
  - “sugars” refers to the sum of **free monosaccharides and disaccharides** in the beverage (exclude artificial or natural **no-calorie sweeteners** from the calculation).
- **Health-claim restriction**
  - Statements (including symbols/vignettes) that characterize the relationship of the product (or sugar content) to a disease/health-related condition are prohibited unless they comply with TTB’s specific health-claim requirements.

#### Alcohol Facts statements (TTB Alcohol FAQs: AF1–AF10)

- **Source (TTB)**: `https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#AF`

TTB allows an **Alcohol Facts** statement (labels and advertisements) to provide **per-serving alcohol content information** without providing nutrient content information, subject to specific content/format rules.

- **When you may use “Alcohol Facts” (TTB)**
  - If the label/advertisement does **not** include any nutrient content statements or claims, you may provide per-serving alcohol content information under the heading `Alcohol Facts`.
  - If you wish to make **any** nutrient content statement/claim along with per-serving alcohol content information, you should use a **Serving Facts** statement instead.
- **Required components (TTB)**
  - Heading: `Alcohol Facts`
  - **Serving size** (must follow the serving sizes in TTB’s Serving Facts guidance)
  - **Servings per container**
  - **Percent alcohol by volume**, **together with** a numerical statement of the **fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving** (rounded to the nearest tenth)
- **Serving sizes (TTB chart; distilled spirits-specific)**
  - Serving size is based on ABV category and product type.
  - For **distilled spirits**:
    - **Above 24% ABV**: `1.5 fl oz (44 ml)`, or `50 ml` for 50 ml containers
    - **Above 16% to 24% ABV**: `2.5 fl oz (74 ml)`
    - **Above 7% to 16% ABV**: `5 fl oz (148 ml)`
- **How to calculate servings per container (TTB)**
  - Divide total net contents by the serving size and round to the **nearest quarter serving**.
- **How to calculate fluid ounces of alcohol per serving (TTB)**
  - \( \text{fl oz alcohol per serving} = (\text{serving size in fl oz}) \times (\text{ABV as a decimal}) \)
  - Round to the **nearest tenth** of a fluid ounce.
  - Distilled spirits example provided in the FAQ: `1.5 fl oz` serving at `40%` ABV → `1.5 × 0.4 = 0.6 fl oz` of alcohol per serving.
- **Per container display (TTB)**
  - May be stated per container size only if the container size is **equal to or less than a single serving size**.
  - Otherwise, per-serving is required; a per-serving + per-container dual format is described as an option.
- **Type size / legibility (TTB)**
  - Generally, no minimum type size requirement is stated for Alcohol Facts statements; however, the information should be readily legible and on a contrasting background.
  - If used to satisfy an alcohol content statement requirement, it must meet the relevant **type size and placement** requirements for alcohol content.
- **Does it satisfy mandatory alcohol content statement requirements? (TTB)**
  - TTB explains that because Alcohol Facts includes percent alcohol by volume, it can satisfy alcohol content statement requirements **as long as** it complies with required placement and type size.
  - **Distilled spirits caution**: if you rely on Alcohol Facts to satisfy the mandatory distilled spirits alcohol content statement, ensure the alcohol content presentation also complies with the distilled spirits alcohol content statement rules (including that `ABV` is not allowed as an abbreviation in the mandatory statement).
- **COLA impact (TTB)**
  - If the only change to an approved label is adding an Alcohol Facts statement following the FAQ guidelines and using one of the example formats, TTB states a new COLA submission is not necessary.
  - Other formats are considered case-by-case and require a new COLA application.

### 6) Organic claims (optional; special rules)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/alfd/alcohol-beverages-labeled-with-organic-claims`
- **Key point (from TTB page)**: Organic claims for alcohol beverages are governed by USDA’s **National Organic Program (NOP)** regulations at **7 CFR Part 205** (TTB notes these rules apply to alcohol beverages even though they are not written/implemented by TTB).
- **Compliance approach (from TTB page)**:
  - TTB indicates it works with USDA (AMS) to align organic-claim information for the alcohol beverage industry.
  - For organic-claim requirements and labeling standards, TTB directs users to USDA AMS/NOP resources.

**Note (HTML-only build limitation)**: The TTB page links to sample label PDFs (including “Sample Distilled Spirit Labels”), which are skipped here, so this section cannot include the detailed organic label templates from those PDFs.

### 7) Personalized labels (optional; special rules)

- **Dedicated TTB page**: `https://www.ttb.gov/node/1109`
TTB’s personalized-label guidance describes when certain “personalizing” changes are permitted and what content is prohibited.

#### What TTB considers a “personalized label” (from TTB G 2017-2)

- A personalized label is a label that:
  - meets the **minimum mandatory label requirements**, and
  - is customized for customers (e.g., personal message, picture, artwork specific to the consumer purchasing the product),
    regardless of material/application (paper labels, etched labels, etc.).
- This guidance does **not** apply to “private labels” (custom labels for purchasers other than the ultimate consumer); those are subject to the same requirements as other labels.

#### What may be changed as “personalizing information” (concepts and examples from TTB)

When a COLA includes permission to change personalizing information, the COLA holder may adjust items such as:

- salutations,
- graphics/artwork,
- names, and
- event dates,

without applying for a new COLA—**but** only within the scope described in the application and covered by the COLA qualification.

#### What is prohibited on personalized labels (key label-content rules)

- Personalized information and artwork are subject to the **same prohibitions** as non-personalized labels (no false/misleading information, no misleading health claims, etc.).
- Personalized information must **not conflict with or qualify** the mandatory information on the label.
- Information that discusses the alcohol beverage or its characteristics is **not** considered “personalizing information” and is **not authorized** by the personalized-label qualification.
- The personalized-label qualification does **not** authorize changing mandatory label information (examples given by TTB include brand name or class/type designation).
