### General Questions

#### G1: Can I produce beer, wine or spirits for my personal or family use without paying Federal excise tax and filing Federal paperwork?

**Beer**

[Production.](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/25_205.htm)

[Removal of beer.](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/25_206.htm)

**Wine**

[Wine for personal or family use.(link is external)](http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2006/aprqtr/27cfr24.75.htm)

**Spirits**

You cannot produce spirits for beverage purposes without paying taxes and without prior approval of paperwork to operate a distilled spirits plant. \[See 26 U.S.C. [5601(link is external)](http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml) & [5602(link is external)](http://uscode.house.gov/browse.xhtml) for some of the criminal penalties. You should also review our [Home Distilling](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1540) page.\] There are numerous requirements that must be met that make it impractical to produce spirits for personal or beverage use. Some of these requirements are paying excise tax, filing an extensive [application(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.72), filing a [bond(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.151), providing adequate [equipment(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.188) to measure spirits, providing suitable [tanks(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.182) and [pipelines(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.187), providing a [separate building(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.52) (other than a dwelling) and maintaining detailed [records(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.581), and filing [reports(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.632). All of these requirements are listed in [27 CFR Part 19.(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-19)

Spirits may be produced for nonbeverage purposes for fuel use only without payment of tax, but you also must file an [application,(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.672) receive TTB's [approval(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.678), and follow requirements, such as [construction(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.703), [use,(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.727) [records(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.718) and [reports(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.720).

#### G2: What are the federal and state excise taxes rates for spirits, wine and beer?

[**FEDERAL EXCISE TAX**](https://www.ttb.gov/tax-audit/special-occupational-tax-and-fee-rate)

View the [federal tax rates for wine, beer, and distilled spirits](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1319).

[**STATE EXCISE TAX**(link is external)](https://taxadmin.org/state-beer-excise-taxes/)

For information on the state taxes imposed on wine, beer, and distilled spirits, please visit [www.TaxAdmin.org(link is external)](https://taxadmin.org/state-beer-excise-taxes/#Excise), or contact the appropriate [state tax or revenue agency(link is external)](http://www.taxadmin.org/state-tax-agencies).

#### G3: Who can I contact when I have a complaint or suspect illegal activity by a bar, club, liquor store, restaurant or other business selling beverage alcohol products (spirits, wine or beer)?

With the exception of labeling, advertising and containers, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau does not enforce laws about selling or serving spirits, wine or beer to consumers. Usually, State governments regulate persons selling or serving spirits, wine or beer to consumers. This includes the minimum legal age that a person may sell or serve. Most States have commissions or agencies, which oversee persons and businesses that sell or serve beverage alcohol products. Contact the [appropriate State agency](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) for help in these areas. Also, visit the [Department of Transportation(link is external)](https://www.transportation.gov/) website about restricting certain funds if a State allows the purchase or public possession of beverage alcohol products under the age of 21.

ACTIVITIES NOT RELATED TO BEVERAGE ALCOHOL PRODUCTS (spirits, wine or beer) - If you have information about illegal activities that do not involve beverage alcohol products (for example, drug sales or prostitution), report this information to the appropriate law enforcement agency. If you have information about illegal activities involving firearms, explosives, arson, or tobacco products, report this information to the [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives(link is external)](https://www.atf.gov/) **.**

**Phone: 202-453-2251 (extension 2)**

#### G4: Does TTB have information or studies about the effects of consuming alcohol?

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau does not normally conduct studies or maintain information about alcohol consumption because we do not enforce laws or regulations relating to the effects from consuming alcohol. The Bureau has [regulations about labeling and advertising](https://www.ttb.gov/node/869) and is committed to preventing consumer deception in beverage alcohol products.

There are several Federal web site addresses that may beneficial: [https://www.whitehouse.gov(link is external)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/); [https://www.hhs.gov/(link is external)](https://www.hhs.gov/); [https://www.samhsa.gov/(link is external)](https://www.samhsa.gov/); [https://www.justice.gov/(link is external)](https://www.justice.gov/);

You can also contact the [National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism(link is external)](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohol-health), 6000 Executive Blvd., Bethesda, MD 20892-7003 (301-443-3860).

Also, you may want to contact industry associations that represent beverage alcohol products industries. For example, from the Internet you should be able to reach the [Wine Institute(link is external)](http://www.wineinstitute.org/), the [Distilled Spirits Council of the United States(link is external)](https://www.distilledspirits.org/), and the [Beer Institute(link is external)](http://www.beerinstitute.org/).

#### G5: How does TTB change its regulations?

See "How Laws and Regulations are Made" at [Rulemaking Process](https://www.ttb.gov/rrd/rulemaking-process).

#### G6: Can a student make alcohol as part of a science fair project?

Well, under current law and regulations, we cannot allow you to conduct experiments involving distillation of alcohol at your home.

As an alternative, Federal law allows us to issue a permit for an alcohol fuel plant, or AFP. Under this type of permit, experiments with alcohol fuels can be conducted at locations properly qualified with TTB.

Here's what has to be done:

An authorized representative of your school (a teacher or other school official) must complete and forward an application form 5110.74 to us to establish a small AFP at your school.

The experiment must be conducted at your school under appropriate adult supervision.

The school official must tell us how long the experiment will last. They may allow for additional time in case your experiment is selected for additional competition or display at a regional or area science fair. And,

The school official must describe the adult supervision that will be provided. We require this because we are concerned about the safety of children handling hazardous materials and using distillation equipment with alcohol-even with adult supervision.

These steps apply primarily to students who are in elementary through high school. Make sure your application is filed as soon as possible to allow enough time for us to process it. You cannot begin the experiment until we issue you a permit.

Application form 5110.74 and additional information are available from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, National Revenue Center, Spirits Unit A, 550 Main Street, Room 8970, Cincinnati, OH 45202-3222, 1-877-882-3277, or submit an [online inquiry](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-nrc).

#### G7: Are commercial vinegar producers regulated by TTB?

Yes. Many vinegar production methods include a stage where alcohol has developed but vinegar, with its distinctive sour taste, has not. TTB regulates commercial vinegar production when there is a potential Federal excise tax liability as beverage alcohol under 26 U.S.C. 5001, 5041, or 5051 at any stage of production, including on raw materials used to make the vinegar.

Finished vinegar is not subject to alcohol beverage excise tax for any one of the following reasons:

- the manufacturing process makes it unsuitable for beverage use;
- the manufacturing process does not involve the production of alcohol; or
- none of the ingredients used to make the vinegar are subject to excise tax.

TTB does not regulate the following types of commercial vinegar production:

- vinegar made by diluting acetic acid;
- wine vinegar made from purchased wine that was made unfit for beverage use by the producing winery; or
- rice or malt vinegar made from purchased rice wine or beer that was made unfit for beverage use by the producing brewery.

Generally, all other vinegar production methods are regulated by TTB.

The TTB requirements to produce various types of finished vinegar are discussed below. Our website contains [links](https://www.ttb.gov/what-we-do/regs-guidance/regulations) to the TTB regulations cited on this page.

**Wine vinegar**

The regulations covering wine and wine vinegar production are in [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-24) – Wine.

If you make vinegar from fresh fruit or juice, (this type of vinegar is classified as nonbeverage wine) you must:

- Qualify as a bonded wine cellar by filing an application and bond with TTB using [Permits Online](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1015). See ["Getting started in the Wine Industry"](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2130) for more information. If you make only vinegar, you will not need the Federal Alcohol Administration Act wine producer's permit that is required for producers of beverage wine.
- [Obtain approval for your formula](https://www.ttb.gov/node/585) indicating how you plan to make nonbeverage wine /vinegar.
- Keep records and file reports in accordance with [27 CFR part 24, subpart O(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-24#27:1.0.1.1.19.15). You will not be subject to excise tax if you make only finished vinegar according to your approved formula.

If you make vinegar from purchased beverage wine on which no tax has been paid, you must:

- File a bond ( [TTB Form 5510.2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f55102.pdf "f55102.pdf")) with TTB to cover the tax on wine on hand, in transit, and unaccounted for until it is made into vinegar.
- Purchase the wine in bond from a bonded wine cellar or winery.
- In accordance with [27 CFR 24.291(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-24#27:1.0.1.1.19.14.346.17), keep records of wine received, wine used in the manufacture of vinegar, vinegar produced, and vinegar removed, and allow examination of your premises by TTB officers.

If you make vinegar from beverage wine on which the excise taxes are paid, TTB cannot refund the tax to you. Your operations will not be regulated by TTB.

If you make vinegar from wine that was made unfit for beverage use by the producing wine cellar or winery (therefore has no tax liability), then your operations are not regulated by TTB.

**Malt or rice vinegar**

The regulations covering production of beer or rice wine (saké) are in [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25) – Beer. Nonbeverage products made from beer or rice wine at breweries under approved formulas will not be subject to the Federal excise tax on beer when they are removed for sale.

If you produce your own beer or rice wine in the making of vinegar, you must:

- Qualify with TTB as a brewer by filing a [Brewer's Notice and bond](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2314) with TTB. In addition, you must obtain approval of the manufacturing of vinegar as an "other authorized use" of the brewery under [27 CFR 25.23(b)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25#27:1.0.1.1.20.3.371.3) prior to production.
- [Obtain approval of your formula](https://www.ttb.gov/node/585) indicating how you plan to make nonbeverage beer or rice wine.
- Keep records and file reports in accordance with [27 CFR part 25, subpart U(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25#27:1.0.1.1.20.21).
- File tax returns, even when no tax is due (see [27 CFR 25.164(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25#27:1.0.1.1.20.11.382.11)).

If you purchase beer or rice wine that was made unfit for beverage use by the producing brewery, you may make that beer or rice wine into vinegar and your operations will not be regulated by TTB.

By law, beer or rice wine that is fit for beverage use cannot be transferred from the brewery to a manufacturer without payment of tax. If you make vinegar from beverage beer or rice wine on which the excise taxes are paid, TTB cannot refund the tax to you. Your operations will not be regulated by TTB.

**Vinegar produced by distilling or the vaporizing process**

If you want to produce vinegar by the "vaporizing process" (a process that involves the distillation of alcohol), see our information on [qualifying as a distilled spirits plant](https://www.ttb.gov/applications/distilled-spirits-plant-dsp-industrial) under [27 CFR Part 19(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-19). See [27 CFR part 19 subpart W(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-19#27:1.0.1.1.15.23) for rules on production of vinegar by the vaporizing process.

**Manufacturer of nonbeverage products (MNBP)**

If you buy taxpaid distilled spirits for vinegar production, TTB has a system for allowing drawback of most of the distilled spirits tax. See [27 CFR part 17(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.13;idno=27;cc=ecfr) and [our frequently asked questions](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/frequently-asked-questions) to learn about the formula approval and claim process.

**Vinegar production using specially denatured alcohol (SDA)**

"Specially denatured" alcohol is a distilled spirits product with certain materials added that make it unfit for beverage use, but suitable for industrial uses. These denatured alcohol products may be shipped free of tax to persons who hold TTB permits as industrial alcohol users. See [27 CFR part 20(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.16;idno=27;cc=ecfr) and ["Information for Specially Denatured Spirits Applicants"](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/p51503.pdf "p51503.pdf") for the permit, formula approval, and recordkeeping requirements for SDA users. Use [Permits Online](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1015) to apply.

Three formulas of SDA are authorized as a raw material for vinegar production. In two of them (SDA formulas 29 and 35-A), the denaturant is ethyl acetate, and in the other (SDA formula 18), the denaturant is vinegar. See [27 CFR 21.43(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.17;idno=27;cc=ecfr#27:1.0.1.1.17.4.285.13), [21.56(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.17;idno=27;cc=ecfr#27:1.0.1.1.17.4.285.26), and [21.62(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.17;idno=27;cc=ecfr#27:1.0.1.1.17.4.285.32) for the specific formulas. Commercial strength vinegar made from SDA may contain trace amounts of residual alcohol, not to exceed 0.5 percent alcohol by volume, in the finished product ( [27 CFR 20.104(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-20#27:1.0.1.1.16.7.278.10)).

**Labeling of vinegar**

Check with the [Food and Drug Administration(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/) for vinegar labeling rules.

**Other requirements**

Check with your [State alcohol regulatory agency](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) to see if they regulate vinegar production.

#### G8: Can I make vinegar for personal use?

If you want to produce wine or malt vinegar for personal or family use and not for sale, the quantity may be included in the amount of wine or beer produced under the exemption in [27 CFR 24.75(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-24#27:1.0.1.1.19.3.332.35) or [27 CFR 25.205-207(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=b127527c689bf67e7682a7cd3c269763;rgn=div5;view=text;node=27%3A1.0.1.1.20;idno=27;cc=ecfr#27:1.0.1.1.20.12.390). Please note that only a qualified distilled spirits plant may distill. There are no personal exemptions for production of distilled spirits.

#### G9: Does TTB regulate butanols, such as isobutanol?

Isobutanol is a type of alcohol that may be produced from petroleum or by fermentation, and TTB requirements may apply depending on the circumstances. TTB's authority under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) includes requirements relating to "distilled spirits." Under the IRC, this term includes ethyl alcohol in any form (e.g., beverage alcohol or fuel ethanol) except beer or wine. Although the term does not include isobutanol, TTB requirements apply if distilled spirits are produced or used in connection with isobutanol manufacturing. For example, if a manufacturer produces isobutanol by a fermentation process that also generates ethyl alcohol and the manufacturer separates the materials using distillation, the manufacturer may be required to qualify as a distilled spirits plant under 27 CFR part 19. For more information contact the [Regulations and Rulings Division online](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-rrd).

#### G10: Do I need a permit to import beverage alcohol products for my own use, or to ship or bring my personal alcohol collection into the U.S. from overseas?

Please visit TTB's [Personal Importation of Beverage Alcohol Products](https://www.ttb.gov/node/632) page for information on bringing alcohol into the U.S. for non-commercial purposes.

#### G11: Can I import alcohol beverages (such as rum) made in Cuba into the United States?

The commercial importation into the United States of alcohol beverages made in Cuba is prohibited. Additionally, effective September 24, 2020, travelers returning to the United States may no longer bring back with them alcohol beverages of Cuban origin for personal use. You may contact the [Office of Foreign Assets Control(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) (OFAC) of the United States Department of the Treasury for additional information. See OFAC's Final Rule, " [Cuban Assets Control Regulations(link is external)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/09/24/2020-21084/cuban-assets-control-regulations)" (September 24, 2020).

#### G12: Can I import alcohol beverages of Russian Federation origin into the United States?

The importation of alcohol beverages of Russian Federation Origin into the United States is prohibited. On March 11, 2022, the President issued an [Executive Order(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/russia_eo_20220311.pdf) (EO) prohibiting the importation of alcohol beverages of Russian Federation origin. The EO is effective immediately. However, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Russia-related General License (GL) 17 to authorize the import of certain items pursuant to pre-existing written contracts or written agreements through March 25, 2022 ( [see OFAC FAQ 1024(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1024#:~:text=E.O.%20of%20March%2011%2C%202022,diamonds%20of%20Russian%20Federation%20origin) for additional information on GL 17 and [OFAC FAQ 1027(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/faqs/1027) defining the terms in the EO). See OFAC's [Ukraine/Russia-related Sanctions(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information/ukraine-russia-related-sanctions) for additional information, or you may contact [OFAC(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/contact-ofac).

#### G13: Can I export alcohol beverages to Russia and Belarus?

The exportation of certain alcohol beverages to Russia or Belarus, or to Russian or Belarusian individuals on the [Office of Foreign Assets Control’s (OFAC)(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/contact-ofac) list of [Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN List)(link is external)](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/specially-designated-nationals-and-blocked-persons-list-sdn-human-readable-lists), wherever located, is prohibited effective March 11, 2022. See the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security’s (BIS) Final Rule “ [Imposition of Sanctions on ‘Luxury Goods’ Destined for Russia and Belarus and for Russian and Belarusian Oligarchs and Malign Actors Under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR),(link is external)](https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2022-05604/export-administration-regulations-imposition-of-sanctions-on-luxury-goods-destined-for-russia-and)” (March 16, 2022).

### Business Questions

#### BU1: What must I do if I want to start a business that sells or imports beverage alcohol products (spirits, wine, and beer)?

While TTB does not regulate the licensing of persons who make retail sales of alcohol to consumers, retailers of alcohol beverages are required to file a registration form with TTB on [TTB F 5630.5d](https://www.ttb.gov/forms/special-occupational-tax-repeal-s) and to maintain certain [records(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-31#27:1.0.1.1.26.10.549). Retailers must file [TTB F 5630.5d](https://www.ttb.gov/forms/special-occupational-tax-repeal-s) when beginning sales of alcohol, whenever there are changes to the previous registration, and when the retail alcohol business is discontinued.

Persons who wish to wholesale (buying alcohol for sale to another wholesaler or to a retailer) or import alcohol beverages must obtain a permit from TTB before starting operations. Visit our [Permits Online](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/index.php?Itemid=1015) homepage to learn more about applying for a wholesaler or importer permit. In addition, alcohol wholesalers and importers are required to submit a registration form on [TTB F 5630.5d](https://www.ttb.gov/forms/special-occupational-tax-repeal-s) and [keep records(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-31#27:1.0.1.1.26.10.547). Read more information on [wholesaling and importing alcohol](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1285).

Each State also regulates businesses that sell alcohol beverages. Alcohol businesses must comply with all State and local requirements in addition to the TTB requirements. See the [list](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) of State alcohol regulatory agencies.

If you have additional questions, contact the National Revenue Center by phone at 1-877-882-3277 or [online](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-nrc).

#### BU2: What is required to sell beverage alcohol products (spirits, wine, or beer) on the Internet?

The Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) issued [TTB Ruling 2000-1](https://www.ttb.gov/node/901540) concerning direct shipments and sales that includes sales transacted on the Internet. You are still subject to the same TTB requirements for selling spirits, wine, or beer. In addition, you also need to contact the appropriate [State government agencies](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) where you and your purchaser are located. Ask whether you need licenses or permits and who needs to pay any taxes and what other requirements may apply.

#### BU3: Can a business get back the tax money from alcohol or tobacco if the product is destroyed in a disaster such as a fire, earthquake, flood, or tornado?

Under certain circumstances, the tax money may be refunded for alcohol and tobacco products. See TTB Information sheet I 1200.68 (11-2004). Go to [claim form](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f56208.pdf "f56208.pdf").

#### BU4: I do not run a bar or liquor store, but sometimes I include alcohol beverages with my product or service. Do I owe Special Occupational Tax (SOT) as a liquor dealer?

No. There is no more Special Tax for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2005. However, if you failed to pay Special (Occupational) Tax for tax periods ending before or on June 30, 2005, you may be liable.

Retail liquor dealers must still keep records and register with TTB. Even though you do not run a bar or liquor store, we may consider you a retail liquor dealer if you conduct activities similar to the following examples:

- Operate a limousine service and serve complimentary drinks to passengers,
- Sell gift baskets that include wine, or
- Run a bed-and-breakfast and serve complimentary drinks to guests in the afternoon.

If you make a separate charge for the alcohol beverage (or if you charge different prices for your product or service with and without the alcohol beverage) you are definitely a retail liquor dealer.

If you have any state or local license that authorizes your business to sell beverage alcohol products, you are a retail liquor dealer.

Even if you do not make a separate charge or have a State or local liquor license, if the complimentary alcohol beverage is always included in the product or service, or if you advertise that your product or service includes a complimentary alcohol beverage, you are a retail liquor dealer. If an alcohol beverage is presented as "complimentary" to clients who pay for a particular product or service, we consider the cost as built into the charge for the product or service. If you provide alcohol beverages to most of your customers, but a particular customer declines to accept the alcohol beverage or if certain customers may not be lawfully served, we will still consider you to be engaged in the business of selling or offering beverage alcohol products for sale.

A true complimentary or gift situation, where a business that serves alcohol beverages is not considered a retail liquor dealer, is likely to be a rare situation.

If you have questions about whether your business is a retail liquor dealer, contact the TTB National Revenue Center at 1-877-882-3277. We will consider the nature of the business, the manner of operation and the advertising of the business to determine if the intent is to "sell" alcohol beverages.

#### BU5: I want to open a business that sells beverage alcohol products at retail such as a bar, catering service or carryout, how do I get a license and will I owe any Federal Tax or Fees?

If you sell beverage alcohol as part of your business, you must [register](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2583:repeal-sot&catid=93) your business using [TTB F 5630.5d](https://www.ttb.gov/forms/special-occupational-tax-repeal-s). Beverage alcohol means distilled spirits, wine, beer, mixed drinks, and beer or wine coolers.

Note: If you operated such a business prior to July 1, 2005, and did not pay Special (Occupational) Tax you may still be liable. This tax applied to persons who sold on or off premises or who provided alcoholic beverages as part of the cost of an item or service. You may have owed this tax even when you did not make a profit or when you were exempt from income tax. We have a [list of businesses](https://www.ttb.gov/nrc/retail-beverage-alcohol-dealers) that may have been subject to this tax.

**The TTB does NOT issue a license to sell tobacco or beverage alcohol products at retail. You must contact your** [**State**](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268 "index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2663:state-abc&catid=99") **or local licensing authority to obtain a retail license.**

#### BU6: I am planning to file an application with TTB for a permit or other approval to operate (such as a brewer's notice). Can I file the application although I'm not quite ready to open for business?

You do not need to be ready to open your business at the time you file your application, but you must be able to provide all the information required for the application. Depending on the application type, required information may include a description of the premises and certain equipment you will use. Therefore, you should generally have construction complete and necessary equipment in place or on order. TTB publishes [average application processing times](https://www.ttb.gov/nrc/statistics-original-applications-to-operate) to assist applicants in planning their operations, but the time necessary to process each application may vary.

#### AD5: Does TTB require pre-market review and approval of advertising material or retail cartons?

The TTB regulations do not require review and approval of alcohol beverage advertisements or retail cartons prior to broadcast, publication, or printing. TTB will review these items for compliance at the industry member's request at any time. While there is no requirement for preapproval of advertisements or cartons, asking TTB to pre‐clear them may avoid costs that might otherwise be associated with revising or withdrawing a noncompliant advertisement or carton after its broadcast, publication, or printing. To request pre-market review and clearance of these materials, submit images of the advertisement or carton to our office at [market.compliance@ttb.gov(link sends email)](mailto:market.compliance@ttb.gov). Please include the applicable Certificate of Label Approval ID number(s) for the associated product(s).

Last reviewed/updated 09/27/2023

#### AD6: How do I report noncompliant advertising that I see in the marketplace?

If you have a complaint about an alcohol beverage advertisement that you believe is in violation of TTB regulations, you may send an email to [market.compliance@ttb.gov(link sends email)](mailto:market.compliance@ttb.gov) or contact us by telephone at 202-453-2251 (option 4). We encourage you to include as much information as possible, including images of the advertising material. We will review the information and, if necessary, take appropriate action.

Last reviewed/updated 09/27/2023

#### AD7: How does TTB view the term “clean” when used on labels or advertisements?

TTB regulations do not define the word “clean,” and we do not have standards for the use of the term on labels or in advertisements. Thus, consumers should not interpret the term as meaning that the beverage is organic or has met other production standards set by TTB. Instead, we review both labels and advertisements in their totality to determine if they create a misleading impression.

In some cases, the term “clean” is simply being used as a descriptor of the taste of the beverage and is considered puffery. For example, “X winery makes a clean, crisp wine.”

In other cases, the term is used together with other language to create the misleading impression that consumption of the alcohol beverage will have health benefits, or that the health risks otherwise associated with alcohol consumption will be mitigated. For example, “X malt beverage is clean and healthy” or “Y vodka’s clean production methods mean no headaches for you.” We would consider those claims to be misleading health-related statements.

Last reviewed/updated 09/27/2023

#### AD8: How does TTB view social media influencers in the context of alcohol beverage advertising?

TTB advertising regulations apply to advertisements published, disseminated, or caused to be published or disseminated by an industry member directly, indirectly, or through an affiliate. Accordingly, if an industry member causes a social media influencer (for example, by payment or other thing of value) to create content that advertises the industry member, its brand, or a specific product, TTB would consider such content as an advertisement under §§ [4.61(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-G/section-4.61), [5.232(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N/section-5.232), and [7.232(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N/section-7.232). Accordingly, such advertisements must contain all mandatory statements required by the regulations (in §§ [4.62(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-G/section-4.62), [5.233(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N/section-5.233), and [7.233(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N/section-7.233)). Additionally, the regulations regarding prohibited practices or statements (in §§ [4.64(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-G/section-4.64), [5.235(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N/section-5.235), and [7.235(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N/section-7.235)) also apply.

Although the regulations do not require that mandatory statements appear in a particular location, TTB strongly recommends that, for the benefit of consumers, advertisers consider placing mandatory statements either in the advertisement itself or in a location where a viewer would most logically expect to find information about the brand or the company. If space is restricted in a manner that makes it difficult to include the mandatory information on the advertisement, this requirement may be satisfied by providing a link to another webpage that contains all of the mandatory information. The link should be clearly named or marked as to indicate that the mandatory company and/or product information can be found by clicking on the link. In addition, the link should take the user directly to the mandatory information, and not to a more general website that would require additional actions to find the information.

For more information, see [TTB Industry Circular 2024-1, Use of Social Media in the Advertising of Alcohol Beverages](https://www.ttb.gov/public-information/industry-circulars/ttb-industry-circular-2024-1).

#### AD9: Are branded digital media items distributed by industry members subject to advertising regulations under the FAA?

The advertising provisions of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), [27 U.S.C. 205(f)(link is external)](https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid:USC-prelim-title27-section205&num=0&edition=prelim), generally cover a regulated industry member’s publication or dissemination of any advertisement that is in, or is calculated to induce sales in, interstate or foreign commerce, or is disseminated by mail. The regulations apply to advertisements in any media, including the internet or any other electronic site or social network. See 27 CFR [4.61(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-G/section-4.61), [5.232(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N/section-5.232), and [7.232(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N/section-7.232). Thus, advertisements that include digital content are subject to the provisions of the FAA Act.

Branded digital media items (such as digital works of art or other images or written materials) that are published or disseminated through electronic media, including items associated with transfers of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), may be subject to TTB’s advertising regulations, assuming all of the elements of the statute are met. If the advertisements are electronic forms of consumer specialty items (a term that traditionally includes consumer items such as t-shirts and refrigerator magnets), the only mandatory information necessary is the company name of the responsible advertiser or the brand name of the product. See 27 CFR [4.62(c)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#p-4.62(c)(2)), [5.233(e)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N#p-5.233(e)(2)), and [7.233(c)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N#p-7.233(c)(2)). These advertisements may not include statements or representations that violate the prohibited practices regulations for advertisements. See 27 CFR [4.64(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-G/section-4.64), [5.235(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N/section-5.235), and [7.235(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7/subpart-N/section-7.235).

### Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division

#### A1: Questions and Answers for TTB Ruling on Caloric and Carbohydrate Representation in Alcohol Beverage labeling and Advertising.

See "Frequently Asked Questions: TTB Ruling 2004-1" at [https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf")

#### A2: I live in one state and wish to send alcohol to my father in another state. May I send this package through the mail or does the distributor have to send the package?

The U.S. Postal Service does not ship alcohol. Therefore, you will need to contact a private courier service such as FedEx or UPS to ship the alcohol. Also, contact the States to and from which you are shipping to find out if either has any laws or regulations prohibiting this practice.

#### A3: Does TTB charge a fee for label approval? If so, how much does it cost?

You pay no fee either to obtain a copy of the form ( [TTB F 5100.31, Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval](https://www.ttb.gov/node/558)) or to apply for label approval. If you are applying for label approval for the first time, you will need to send a copy of your approved basic permit or brewer's notice (depending on your business). You must also submit your application in duplicate with the labels attached to the front of the form. If your labels are too large to fit on the front of the form, you must reduce them and place the originals on the back of the form. Item no. 17 of the label application should reflect the percentage of reduction.

#### A4: As a student at the University of Kansas, I am researching why alcohol beverages do not have a nutritional value label as do all other foods, includingwater. I would like to know the calorie content and other information of my drink.

On August 10, 1993, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms published an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register that solicited comments from the public and industry on whether the regulations should be amended to require nutritional information on labels of alcohol beverages. The comment period for the ANPRM closed on February 7, 1994.

ATF received 55 comments in response to the advance notice. Only seven of these comments came from consumers. However, five of the seven consumers who commented opposed nutrition labeling. Overall, 80 percent of the comments received in response to the ANPRM opposed nutrition labeling for alcohol beverages. Thirty-five of the comments opposing nutrition labeling were submitted on behalf of industry, both domestic and foreign.

After careful consideration of the petition and the comments received in response to the advance notice, ATF determined that an amendment of the regulations to provide nutrition information on labels of alcohol beverages is unnecessary and unwarranted.

If you have a question about nutritional information on a particular product, you should contact the company by writing to the address on the label. Most companies will assist you if you ask them for this information.

#### A5: I am trying to determine what I need to do to make and sell a fermented apple cider with alcohol content under 7 percent by volume. The Food and Drug Administration claims that this falls entirely within their jurisdiction. Does TTB also regulate these products?

The Food and Drug Administration has primary jurisdiction over the labeling of a fermented cider that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. However, TTB has jurisdiction over some labeling requirements, most importantly the Government Warning Statement for any alcohol beverage over 0.5 percent alcohol by volume. These requirements are specified in 27 CFR part 16.

Most commercial fermented cider producers must register with TTB and pay tax on their cider. There is a very limited exemption from registration and tax requirements for "the non-effervescent product of the normal alcoholic fermentation of apple juice only, which is sold or offered for sale as cider and not as wine or as a substitute for wine." If the fermented cider you make does not fit that exemption, you must register with TTB as a bonded winery, pay tax and follow other rules for winery operation in TTB regulations at 27 CFR part 24, including TTB-enforced wine label requirements in 27 CFR § 24.257.

#### A6: How long does it take to get label approval?

Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) processing times have increased for a number of reasons, including steady growth in the number of applications we receive and reductions in staff available to process applications.

To help you with your planning process, we provide the current average COLA processing times for each commodity (wine, distilled spirits, and malt beverages) on our Web site and through our Customer Service Call Center phone line. This gives you a quick and easy way to check the average number of days we are taking to respond to COLA applications.

You can access average COLA processing times:

- on our Web site [Labeling Home Page](https://www.ttb.gov/node/862), or
- by phone at 202-453-2250 or toll free at 1-866-927-2533 to hear a recorded message:
  - press 4 for malt beverage and distilled spirits labels, and
  - press 6 for wine labels.

Since responding to status inquiries diverts resources away from processing COLAs, we ask that you refrain from contacting us about the status of applications unless we exceed the current average processing time for your commodity. Complying with this request allows the label specialists to focus their attention on processing COLAs.

Finally, it is likely that COLA processing times will continue to be longer than you may have experienced in the past. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you consider this and allow sufficient time for receiving label approval from us.

_ALFD / revised August 2011_

#### A7: Must I have a TTB permit before I can apply for label approval?

Yes, we must issue you a permit, brewer's notice or approval to operate a bonded wine cellar (BWC) or tax paid wine bottling house (TPWBH) before you submit an application for a certificate of label approval.

#### A8: How do I secure a TTB permit or a brewer's notice?

Our National Revenue Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, issues basic permits and brewer's notices. For information on obtaining a basic permit or brewer's notice, contact the National Revenue Center. The toll free number is 1-877-882-3277.

#### A9: What does it mean when your labels are approved?

A certificate of label approval authorizes the certificate holder to bottle and remove or import alcohol beverages that bear labels identical to those shown on the certificate of label approval.

#### A10: We removed this FAQ because it was out-of-date.

None

#### A11: Can I request informal or preliminary comments from TTB on a proposed label?

Due to considerable increases in the number of label approval applications we receive and reductions in staffing, we no longer perform informal review of proposed labels. We offer a variety of resources on the [Labeling Home Page](https://www.ttb.gov/node/862) to help you make sure your labels meet the regulatory requirements.

_ALFD / revised August 2011_

#### A12: If I am only adding my Internet Web site address to a label, do I need to get a new certificate of label approval?

No. We authorize numerous changes that can be made to previously approved labels without applying for a new certificate of label approval (COLA), and the addition of an Internet address is one of the allowable revisions. The entire list of changes that may be made to approved labels without getting a new COLA is found on [TTB F 5100.31, Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf").

#### A14: May I submit my label application electronically?

Please visit [COLAs Online(link is external)](https://www.ttbonline.gov/) for additional information.

#### A15: What is a Statement of Process?

A Statement of Process is a formula for a domestically produced flavored malt beverage, flavored or unflavored rice wine, or saké. A statement of Process consists of 1) a detailed and specific quantitative list of each ingredient in the product and 2) a step-by-step description of the production process. As a minimum, a Statement of Process must include information on the volume and alcohol content of the malt beverage base, identification and source of any flavoring material used in the product, the maximum volume and alcohol content of each flavoring material used in the product, the percentage of alcohol contributed by the flavor(s) to the finished product, a specific description of when flavoring material is added in the production of the product, and the total volume and alcohol content of the finished product.

Statements of Process must be on brewery letterhead.

#### A16: How can I personalize my labels for customers to commemorate special occasions such as weddings, corporate events, etc., without having to submit each version of the personalized label to TTB for approval?

If you want the flexibility to make changes to personalize your labels for customers without the need to submit new applications for each personalized label, you will need to follow the steps noted in public guidance [TTB G 2017-2, Personalized Labels](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1109), dated 9/5/2017.

#### A17: What are bioengineered foods?

Bioengineered foods are food or drink made from plant varieties that are developed from using recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) technology (which is often referred to as "genetic engineering" or "biotechnology"). Specifically, bioengineered foods are produced from plants whose genetic material has been altered by inserting DNA molecules from another organism for the purpose of reproducing beneficial characteristics, such as added nutrition, better flavor, or greater ability to fight pests or diseases, of the original species in the receiving species. In 1994, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established a consultation process that helps ensure that foods developed using biotechnology methods meet the applicable safety standards.

#### A18: Do bioengineered ingredients have any apparent health and safety risks when used in the production of alcohol beverages?

There are no apparent health or safety risks associated with bioengineered foods used in the production of alcohol beverages. TTB has no basis for concluding that alcohol beverages produced from bioengineered ingredients differ from other alcohol beverages in any meaningful or uniform way, or that, as a class, alcohol beverages made from plant ingredients developed by the new techniques present any different or greater safety concern than alcohol beverages made from ingredients developed by traditional plant breeding.

#### A19: What is TTB's position with regard to the labeling statements about alcohol beverage products that are not bioengineered or that do not contain ingredients produced from bioengineered foods? For example, "Contains No GMOs," "GMO Free-Zone" or any similar references on alcohol beverages?

Given the inquiries we have received and interest at the state level, we are reviewing our policy on the use of bioengineered food labeling statements or references on labels under our jurisdiction.

#### A20: Am I permitted to label my product with a specialized farming term to show my compliance with or concern for environmental initiatives and movements?

A description of specialized farming practices generally may appear on alcohol beverage labels as additional information provided it is truthful, accurate, specific, and does not conflict with, or in any manner qualify, mandatory labeling information. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of this field, TTB reserves the right to request clarification and documented verification of any graphics, seals, logos, definitions or language appearing on labels. For instance, any label specifically stating that the producer is certified by an agricultural organization must have documented proof.

Terms that refer to the environmental impact of the process and packaging rather than the product itself are usually acceptable. These words and phrases may not modify mandatory information on brand labels, but might appear as additional information after review on a case-by-case basis.

#### A21: What is required when applying for a certificate of exemption from label approval for my wine label instead of a Certificate of Label Approval on Form 5100.31?

You may apply for a certificate of exemption from label approval for your wine only if it is produced or bottled in the United States and only if it will be sold, offered for sale, shipped, or delivered for shipment within the state in which it was bottled or packed (in other words, it will not be introduced into interstate commerce). This can be accomplished by selecting and completing item 18b on your label application, TTB Form 5100.31. Imported bottled wines are not eligible for a certificate of exemption from label approval and therefore must be covered by a Certificate of Label Approval.

Wines labeled under a certificate of exemption from label approval must show the statement, "For sale in \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_(name of State) only." This statement may be added to a label covered by a certificate of exemption, or may be on an additional label that is affixed to the container. The statement does not have to appear on the label that is submitted to TTB, but must be on the container before it is removed from bond for consumption or sale.

Although the labeling requirements in 27 CFR Part 4, Labeling and Advertising of Wine, do not apply when a certificate of exemption is used, all of the rules in the wine regulations under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), 27 CFR Part 24, continue to apply to all wine bottled and packed in the United States. For example, 27 CFR 24.257(a) outlines what information must appear on your label, as well as the minimum type size requirements, for each bottle or other container of beverage wine prior to removal for consumption or sale. In brief, each label must contain:

- Name & Address of the wine premises where bottled or packed
- Brand name if different from the above
- Alcohol content as percent by volume or as stated in accordance with 27 CFR Part 4
- The kind of wine
- Net contents

Please see the complete text of 27 CFR 24.257 for additional information and guidance. (Note that Part 24 does not apply in Puerto Rico. See 27 CFR 24.2.)

The recordkeeping requirements in the IRC wine regulations continue to apply when a certificate of exemption is used. The wine regulations state in 27 CFR 24.257(b): "The information shown on any label applied to bottled or packed wine is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of \[27 CFR 24.314, Label information record\]," which states:

A proprietor who removes bottled or packed wine with information stated on the label (e.g., varietal, vintage, appellation of origin, analytical data, date of harvest) shall have complete records so that the information appearing on the label may be verified by an \[sic\] TTB audit. A wine is not entitled to have information stated on the label unless the information can be readily verified by a complete and accurate record trail from the beginning source material to removal of the wine for consumption or sale. All records necessary to verify wine label information are subject to the record retention requirements of § 24.300(d).

In addition, Congress recently amended section 5388(c) of the IRC (26 U.S.C. 5388(c)) to restrict the use of certain wine names of European origin for wines sold in the United States. These wine names are: Burgundy, Claret, Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine wine, Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry, Tokay and Retsina. These names may be used on labels for wine from the European Community (and made in accordance with the requirements of the Community) and on certain previously approved non-Community wine labels if their uses are grandfathered as of March 10, 2006. Because the IRC applies to wine regardless of whether it is in intrastate or interstate commerce, the restriction on the use of these names applies in both contexts. Accordingly, TTB will not issue a certificate of exemption for wine using one of these wine names in a manner not authorized by the statute. The change in the law was effective on December 20, 2006.

The Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988, 27 U.S.C. 213 et seq., and implementing regulations in 27 CFR Part 16, which require a specified health warning statement on alcoholic beverages bottled or imported for sale or distribution in the United States, also apply equally to wine sold or shipped in intrastate or interstate commerce. Under Part 16, the required warning statement is a prerequisite for approval of a certificate of exemption from label approval, just as it is for a Certificate of Label Approval.

Finally, other laws may apply to fraudulent conduct used to sell mislabeled wine or to mislead consumers, including certain federal criminal statutes relating to fraud carried out through the use of: the mail; private or commercial interstate carriers; or wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce.

#### A22: TTB has removed this question and answer.

TTB has removed this question and answer on major food allergen labeling because it is no longer applicable.

#### A23: Questions and answers about third party representation in labeling and formulation matters.

TTB has recently noticed an increase in questions from industry members as to whether or not it is mandatory to use third-party representatives in order to receive label or formula approval, and if the Advertising, Labeling and Formulation Division (ALFD) provides special assistance when such representatives are employed. TTB has created some FAQs in order to address these concerns.

#### A24: Questions and answers about TTB Form 5100.51, Formula and Process for Domestic and Imported Alcohol Beverages.

[**Questions and answers about TTB Form 5100.51, Formula and Process for Domestic and Imported Alcohol Beverages.**](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#alfd)

#### A25: I operate a domestic winery and I am making wine from grapes or juice that I have purchased from another state or country. What appellation of origin may I use?

This is a complicated question, and the answer (see 27 CFR §4.25(b)) depends on the particular circumstances. State or local laws and regulations may be more restrictive than Federal laws and regulations in some instances, and, to use an appellation, the wine must conform to the laws and regulations of the named appellation area. (Please note that we use here certain states or regions only as examples to illustrate certain different circumstances.) We advise that you confer with state and local authorities regarding their requirements before finalizing your COLA submission. Remember that your wine, and the records that you keep, must adequately support any claims which are made on your label. The following situations serve as examples. There are certainly more factual circumstances that might have a different outcome.

Situation 1: I am making a wine with grapes or juice originating from a state that is contiguous to (that is, touching) my own state (e.g. when California grapes are used to produce wine in Oregon).Suppose that I have purchased Napa Valley, California, grapes that I will produce into wine in Oregon.

The most specific appellation of origin eligible for use is the name of the contiguous state (California). A viticultural area appellation of origin (e.g. Napa Valley) may NOT be used because the wine was not fully finished within that state.

Situation 2: The state from which the winemaking material originates is not contiguous to the state in which the wine is produced. For example, California grapes have been purchased to produce wine in New York.

The most specific appellation of origin eligible - for use is a country appellation, such as "American." Note that when a country is used as an appellation of origin a vintage date is NOT permissible for the wine.

Situation 3: I am purchasing grapes or juice from another country. An appellation of origin may NOT be used, as this wine is not eligible for such claims (see 27 CFR §4.25(b)(2)(ii)). A vintage date or a varietal designation (e.g. Merlot) may not appear on the wine, as both items require an appellation of origin present on the label. The wine may be labeled only with a more general class or type statement, such as "Red Wine" or "White Wine."

#### A26: This question and answer have been temporarily removed from site pending internal review.

This question and answer have been temporarily removed from site pending internal review.

#### A27: Does my TTB certificate of label approval mean I have trademark protection?

TTB's authority to issue certificates of label approval (COLAs) for alcohol beverage products does not include trademark protection, as is stated in the instructions for [TTB Form 5100.31](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf"), Application for and Certification/Exemption of Label/Bottle Approval. While TTB may be aware of an established trademark when acting on an application for a COLA, that awareness is important only for carrying out the labeling authority under the deception and misleading standards imposed by the Federal Alcohol Administration Act and not for purposes of Federal law applicable to trademarks. Therefore, TTB approval of a COLA neither automatically confers trademark protection, nor indicates that a particular mark may be used in violation of applicable intellectual property law.

The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) provides for trademark registrations and guides United States domestic and international intellectual property policies. The USPTO Web site address is [www.uspto.gov/(link is external)](http://www.uspto.gov/). You may find the USPTO's list of frequently asked questions on the subject of trademarks particularly helpful: [www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp(link is external)](http://www.uspto.gov/faq/trademarks.jsp). The USPTO also has a Web site on trademark protection specifically designed for small business owners at [www.uspto.gov/smallbusiness/(link is external)](https://www.uspto.gov/learning-and-resources/inventors-and-entrepreneurs/small-and-medium-sized-enterprise-resources/).

#### A28: I would like to use social media to inform consumers where to find my products or promote a special event at a restaurant or retailer. Are there any restrictions on this?

As we stated in [TTB Industry Circular 2022-1](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2683), TTB considers advertising in social media to be subject to all of the same requirements and restrictions as any other type of advertising under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) and the TTB implementing regulations ( [27 CFR part 4 subpart G(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#subpart-G), [27 CFR part 5 subpart N(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5/subpart-N?toc=1), and [27 CFR part 7 subpart N(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#subpart-N), and the “tied house” regulations at [27 CFR part 6).(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-6)

The regulations in parts 4, 5 and 7 require certain mandatory statements (e.g., responsible advertiser name and address) to appear in advertisements for wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages, respectively. The regulations also prohibit certain advertising practices and statements from appearing in such advertisements.

Under the tied house regulations in part 6, industry members may not induce a retailer, directly or indirectly, to purchase alcoholic beverages from the industry member to the exclusion of such products offered for sale by other persons.  We consider the listing of a retailer in an industry member’s advertisement, including a social media ad, to be providing a thing of value that constitutes a means to induce that retailer to purchase alcoholic beverages from that industry member. As such, listing a retailer in advertising, including social media advertising, may be a violation of the FAA Act if it results in exclusion as described in [27 CFR 6.151 through 6.153(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=0668ea0ce942080930b4464ee0fd240f&mc=true&n=sp27.1.6.e&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML), subject to the jurisdictional limits at [27 CFR 6.4.(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0668ea0ce942080930b4464ee0fd240f&mc=true&node=se27.1.6_14&rgn=div8)

An exception in [27 CFR 6.98(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0668ea0ce942080930b4464ee0fd240f&mc=true&node=se27.1.6_198&rgn=div8) provides that listing the names and addresses of _two or more unaffiliated retailers_ selling the products of an industry member does not constitute a means to induce. The requirements of the exception are that:

1. The advertisement does not also contain the retail price of the product (except where the exclusive retailer in the jurisdiction is a State or a political subdivision of a State), and
2. The listing is the only reference to the retailers in the advertisement and is relatively inconspicuous in relation to the advertisement as a whole, and
3. The advertisement does not refer only to one retailer or only to retail establishments controlled directly or indirectly by the same retailer, except where the retailer is an agency of a State or a political subdivision of a State.

State laws also apply, and they vary from state to state. We encourage industry members to contact the applicable state alcohol beverage authorities with any questions related to state law. Please see our website for a list of [State Alcohol Beverage Authorities](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268).

#### A29: Will TTB approve any formulas or labels for alcohol beverage products that contain a controlled substance under Federal law, including marijuana?

TTB will not approve any formulas or labels for alcohol beverage products that contain a controlled substance under Federal law, including marijuana. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), 21 U.S.C. § 802(16), defines marijuana as all parts of the _Cannabis sativa_ L. plant (and its derivatives) with certain specific exclusions. Substances (such as tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), cannabidiols (CBD), or terpenes) that are derived from any part of the cannabis plant that is _not excluded_ from the CSA definition of marijuana are controlled substances, regardless of whether such substances are lawful under State law. _See_ Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), [Clarification of the New Drug Code (7350) for Marijuana Extract(link is external)](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/marijuana/m_extract_7350.html) for more information about DEA's position on cannabis derivatives. The parts of the cannabis plant that _are_ excluded from the definition of marijuana in the CSA (referred to here as "hemp" ingredients) include hemp seed oil, sterilized hemp seeds, and non-resinous, mature hemp stalks.

Formula approval from TTB is required before a hemp ingredient may be used in the production of an alcohol beverage product. In determining whether a hemp ingredient is allowable for use in an alcohol beverage, TTB will consult with the DEA where appropriate and defers to the DEA in its interpretation of the CSA.

TTB also consults with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on ingredient safety issues where appropriate. In some cases, TTB may require formula applicants to obtain documentation from FDA indicating that the proposed use of an ingredient in an alcohol beverage would not violate the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. For more information, see [TTB Industry Circular 2019-1, Hemp Ingredients in Alcohol Beverage Formulas](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2141).

For alcohol beverage products containing a hemp ingredient, the product label must accurately and specifically identify the ingredient in a manner that makes it clear that the ingredient is not a controlled substance (e.g., "hemp seed oil" rather than "hemp oil"). Additionally, labeling statements for alcohol beverage products may not create the misleading impression that the product contains a controlled substance or has effects similar to those of a controlled substance.

For more information, including requirements for lab analysis of hemp components, please refer to the " [Hemp Policy](https://www.ttb.gov/node/577)" published by our predecessor agency in 2000.

TTB notes that section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly referred to as the Farm Bill, defines "industrial hemp." _See_ 7 U.S.C. 5940.  Subject to certain restrictions, this law allows an institution of higher education or a State department of agriculture to grow or cultivate industrial hemp for purposes of research where allowed under State law. As explained by the _Statement of Principles on Industrial Hemp_ which was issued by USDA, in consultation with DEA and FDA, and published in the Federal Register on August 12, 2016, section 7606 does not authorize the sale of industrial hemp "for the purpose of general commercial activity." Accordingly, it is TTB's understanding that the Farm Bill does not authorize the use of industrial hemp in the production of alcohol beverage products for sale beyond limited State-sanctioned pilot projects by authorized entities.

#### A30: Can Rhamnus prinoides (“Ethiopian hops”) be used in alcohol beverages? Do requirements and guidance related to hops apply equally to “Ethiopian hops?”

_Rhamnus prinoides_, also known as “Ethiopian hops” or “Gesho,” are not the same hops traditionally used in alcohol beverages that are addressed in the laws and regulations administered by TTB. The scientific name of the hop plant traditionally used and commonly understood to be used in alcohol beverages covered under the laws administered by TTB is _Humulus lupus_.

Consequently, “Ethiopian hops” cannot be used interchangeably with traditional hops when making alcohol beverages, including malt beverages.

#### A31: Has the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized as safe the use of Rhamnus prinoides (“Ethiopian hops”) in alcohol beverages? Will TTB approve an application for a formula approval for an alcohol beverage that contains “Ethiopian hops?”

FDA has not evaluated the safety of _Rhamnus prinoides_ (“Ethiopian hops”) for use in alcohol beverages, has not issued a regulation authorizing the use of “Ethiopian hops” in alcohol beverages, and is not aware of a GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) conclusion for the use of “Ethiopian hops” in alcohol beverages.

Consequently, TTB will not approve an application for formula approval for an alcohol beverage that contains “Ethiopian hops.”

#### A32: Did TTB approve a general use formula for honey wine containing Rhamnus prinoides (“Ethiopian hops”) in TTB Ruling 2016-2?

No. In TTB Ruling 2016-2, TTB approved general-use formulas for certain standard agricultural wines made from honey or certain other agricultural products. Under [27 CFR 24.203(a)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24#24.203), honey wine may be produced with hops in quantities not to exceed one pound for each 1,000 pounds of honey. However, this provision applies only to _Humulus lupus_, which are the hops traditionally used to make alcohol beverages, including malt beverages, addressed in the laws and regulations administered by TTB. _See_ FAQ A30-A31 above.

### Organic Alcohol

#### OA 1: How do the USDA organic regulations apply to alcohol beverages?

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic regulations create standards for the production, handling, processing, labeling, and marketing of all organically produced agricultural products. The regulations also create four labeling categories and identify specific substances that cannot be used in the production of organically made products. To obtain more information about the National Organic Program and to view a full text of the regulations, please visit the National Organic Program Web site at [https://www.ams.usda.gov/nop(link is external)](https://www.ams.usda.gov/nop).

#### OA 2: What is an Organic Claim?

If a bottler or importer uses the word "Organic" in any fashion likely to be perceived as claiming that a product or anything associated with it is organically produced, contains organic ingredients, or was processed in an organic manner or facility, TTB will consider this an organic claim and apply the requirements of the USDA organic regulations at 7 CFR part 205.

#### OA 3: What type of Organic Claims Exist?

The four labeling categories of the USDA organic regulations are as follows (with information pertinent to alcohol beverages):

- **"100% Organic"** contains only organic ingredients and processing aids with no chemically added sulfites.
- **"Organic"** contains at least 95% organic ingredients with no chemically added sulfites.
- **"Made with Organic \[Ingredients\]"** contains at least 70% organic ingredients and may contain up to 100 ppm of sulfites from sulfur dioxide.
- Products containing **less than 70% organic ingredients** and products that are not processed by a certified organic handling operation may only identify each organically produced ingredient in an ingredient statement.

The complete USDA organic composition and labeling requirements are fully described in [7 CFR Subpart D—Labels, Labeling and Market Information(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-7/part-205/subpart-d).

#### OA 4: When I submit a label application for a label with an organic reference, what additional documentation must I submit?

The information required depends on the circumstances. A majority of claims will require you to submit the [Certifier/Accredited Certifying Agent (ACA) Preview.(link is external)](https://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/ams.fetchTemplateData.do?template=TemplateJ&leftNav=NationalOrganicProgram&page=NOPACAs&description=USDA%2520Accredited%2520Certifying%2520Agents)

- A.  For "100% organic" "organic" and "made with organic \[ingredients\]:

**Certifier/ACA Preview** – indicates that an Accredited Certifying Agent (ACA) has reviewed the applicant's label, reconciled it with the applicant's certification, and found the label to be in compliance with USDA organic regulations. The certifier/ACA Preview will show actual images of the labels along with a stamp or signature of the ACA.

- B.  For organic Ingredient statements:

**Producer's/Crop Organic Certificate** \- certifies that the grapes, fruit, or other agricultural produce used in the product comply with the USDA organic regulations. A list of different grapes, fruits, crops, and the year of harvest may appear on the actual certificate or on an attached addendum.

#### OA 5: My imported wine has organic documentation from the European Union/European Commission; will this documentation be sufficient to support my organic claim?

The United States has an organic equivalence arrangement with the European Union (EU). Under the terms of this arrangement, wine imported from the EU with organic labeling must comply with the labeling requirements of the USDA organic regulations.

For wine labeled “organic,” an EU control body must verify that prohibited substances, such as sulfur dioxide or potassium metabisulphite, were not added to the wine. For wine labeled “made from organic grapes,” an EU control body must ensure that no prohibited substances are used, except there is an allowance for the use of sulfur dioxide. The EU control body must verify that the total sulfite concentration from sulfur dioxide does not exceed 100 parts per million. Nonagricultural substances not listed under 7 CFR 205.605 are prohibited in wine labeled “organic” or “made with organic grapes.”

The certifier/ACA preview must be submitted to TTB; this indicates that the EU control body has verified compliance with these terms of the EU-U.S. organic equivalence arrangement.

Organic certificate(s) submitted to TTB (if required- see Question 4) must be in English or have complete translation(s) attached.

#### OA 6: What is a certifier/ACA Preview?

Certifiers/ACAs are private, State, and foreign entities accredited by the USDA for certifying foreign and domestic organic crop, livestock, and handling operations to USDA organic standards. All labeling applicants that are certified organic handlers and intend to make an organic claim (other than in an ingredient statement) on an alcohol beverage must submit the label(s) to their certifier/ACA for review and approval prior to submission to TTB. The certifier/ACA Preview is a document that must show actual images of the exact labels along with a stamp or signature of the certifier/ACA to verify that the product label complies with the USDA organic regulations. The National Organic Program maintains a list of Accredited Certifying Agents on its Web site at: [https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/organic-certification/certifying-agents(link is external)](https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/organic-certification/certifying-agents).

#### OA 7: Where do I obtain the certifier/ACA Preview for organic imported products?

The producers/handlers of alcohol products that will be imported into the United States are responsible for supplying copies of the required documents to the importer. The importer should request the documents from the handler or the producer's wholesale distributer for submission with your Certificate of Label Approval application.

#### OA 8: What documents must be provided if I want to state, "Made with Organically Grown \[Ingredients\]?"

To use "Made with Organically Grown \[Ingredients\]" on a label, you must submit a certifier/ACA preview.

#### OA 9: What else must I know if I want to state, "Made with Organically Grown Grapes?"

- The USDA organic seal, or foreign equivalent, is not allowed.
- Use of non-organic grapes is not permitted.
- Sulfur dioxide is the only sulfiting agent allowed; total sulfite concentration must not exceed 100 ppm. Sulfite disclosure is required on the label.
- The disclosure of organic ingredients on the label must be in the form of a phrase such as "Made with Organic \[specify your organic ingredients here\].” Examples are: "Made with Organically Grown Grapes," "Made with Organic Grapes," "Made with Organic Grapes from Our Vineyard," or "Made with Organically Produced Grapes."
- A Certification Statement “Certified Organic by---” or a similar phrase must appear below the bottler or importer's name and address statement.

#### OA 10: What is a "Certification Statement," and where must it go on a label?

The statement, "Certified Organic by---" or a similar phrase followed by the name of the certifier/ACA must appear below the bottler or importer's name and address statement. The organic certification statement must appear under the importer's name and address on imported products if the foreign producer/bottler's information is not present. We will accept the certification statement beneath either the importer or the foreign producer/bottler's information when present on imported labels. The business address, Internet address, or telephone number of the certifying agent may be included on the label. Certifier/ACA acronyms are acceptable in certification statements; however, logos or seals alone do not fulfill this requirement.

#### OA 11: I have an organic crop certificate, but the producer is not a certified organic handler. What type of organic claim can be made on the label?

The only organic claim that can be made on the label is in an ingredient statement to indicate which ingredients are organic. If the organically produced ingredients are identified in the ingredient statement, the product's percentage of organic contents may be displayed on the information panel (7 CFR § 205.305). Acceptable variations include "X% Organic" or "X% Organic ingredients."

#### OA 12: If the vintage date changes on my approved organic label, do I need to submit a new application?

No, the vintage date may change on an organic label without obtaining a new Certificate of Label Approval.

#### OA 13: What are some common mistakes made when submitting organic labels?

The lack of supporting documentation for organic claims creates the greatest delay in label processing. In a majority of situations, the certifier/ACA preview will satisfy the requirement. A second common mistake occurs when submitters do not closely check the supporting documents to ensure that information listed on the product corresponds to the associated paperwork. Expired documentation, documents citing the incorrect product, and date conflicts represent common reasons why applications are returned.

#### OA 14: Aside from terms using the word "Organic," am I permitted to label my product with a specialized farming term to show my compliance with or concern for environmental initiatives and movements?

A description of specialized farming practices generally may appear on alcohol beverage labels as additional information provided it is truthful, accurate, specific, and does not conflict with, or in any manner qualify, mandatory labeling information. However, due to the constantly evolving nature of this field, TTB reserves the right to request clarification and documented verification of any graphics, seals, logos, definitions, or language appearing on labels. For instance, any label specifically stating that the producer is certified by an agricultural organization must have documented proof.

Terms that refer to the environmental impact of the process and packaging rather than the product itself are usually acceptable. These words and phrases may not modify mandatory information on brand labels, but might appear as additional information after review on a case-by-case basis.

### Flavored Malt Beverages

#### FMB1: How does TTB TD-21 impact the composition of flavored malt beverages?

The new regulation permits the addition of flavors and other nonbeverage materials containing alcohol to beers and malt beverages. Malt beverages that contain not more than 6% alcohol by volume may derive no more than 49% of their alcohol content from flavors and other nonbeverage materials. If a malt beverage contains more than 6% alcohol by volume, not more than 1.5% of the volume of the finished product may consist of alcohol derived from flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol.

#### FMB2 : When do these new standards go into effect?

The final rule takes effect on January 3, 2006.

#### FMB3 : My brewery produces a flavored malt beverage that derives over 90% of its alcohol content from added nonbeverage flavors, and only 10% of its alcohol content from fermentation at the brewery. What can we do if we want to continue to make this product on and after January 3, 2006?

On and after January 3, 2006, a product that does not comply with the requirements of TTB TD-21 may not be produced at a brewery, bottled at a brewery, removed from a brewery with or without payment of tax, removed from customs custody for consumption, or (in the case of products not destined for exportation), transferred to a second customs bonded warehouse.

#### FMB4 : Does the final rule apply to imported as well as domestic malt beverages?

Yes.

#### FMB5 : The rule requires mandatory alcohol content labeling for flavored malt beverages. My brewery produces a fruit-flavored ale that derives 0.4% of its alcohol content from an added flavor. Do we need to label this ale with an alcohol content statement?

Yes. The final rule requires an alcohol content statement on the label of any malt beverage that contains any alcohol derived from added flavors or other added nonbeverage ingredients (other than hop extract) containing alcohol.

#### FMB6 : May I place the mandatory alcohol content statement on the back label?

No. The mandatory alcohol content statement must appear on the brand label.

#### FMB7 : My brewery produces a malt beverage made with a hop extract that adds a very minimal amount of alcohol to the product. Do we have to label this malt beverage with an alcohol content statement?

As long as the malt beverage does not derive alcohol from any other added flavor or other added nonbeverage ingredient, it does not have to be labeled with an alcohol content statement.

#### FMB8 : If I ship my beer to another state, and that state has different labeling requirements, am I required to comply with those labeling requirements?

You are required to comply with the labeling laws of any state in which \[or "where"\] you sell your malt beverages. The labeling requirements of Title 27 [Part 7(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-7) of our regulations apply only to the extent that State law imposes similar requirements on malt beverages sold within the State.

#### FMB9 : The only change that my brewery must make to the label is to add the required alcohol content statement. Are we required to file a new application for label approval, or should we simply add the alcohol content statement to the label?

Your company may add an alcohol content statement to the label without applying for a new certificate of label approval.

#### FMB10 : What new labeling and advertising provisions have been added to the regulations?

Consistent with [ATF Ruling 2002-2](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/2002-2.htm), the final rule prohibits the use of labeling or advertising statements, designs, devices, or representations that tend to create a false or misleading impression that a malt beverage contains distilled spirits or is a distilled spirits product.

#### FMB11 : My brewery's flavored malt beverage is labeled with a brand name that is also the brand name of a well-known distilled spirits product. Does TTB TD-21 allow this labeling practice?

The final rule provides that the use of a brand name of a distilled spirits product as the brand name of a malt beverage is not prohibited, provided that the overall label or advertisement does not present a misleading impression about the identity of the product.

#### FMB12 : Does the final rule allow the use of cocktail names on FMB labels?

The final rule permits the use of a cocktail name as the brand name or fanciful name of a malt beverage, provided that the overall label or advertisement does not present a misleading impression about the identity of the product.

#### FMB13 : How have the statement of process requirements changed?

Current regulations require brewers to file a statement of process whenever they propose to produce and market a fermented beverage under a name other than "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor." Under the new regulations, brewers will be required to file formulas (instead of statements of process) under the circumstances set forth in the regulations.

#### FMB14 : What brewing processes will trigger the formula requirement?

Formulas will be required whenever the brewer intends to produce a fermented product that will be treated by any processing, filtration, or other method of manufacture that is not generally recognized as a traditional process in the production of a fermented beverage designated as "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor."

#### FMB15 : What are examples of non-traditional processes that require the filing of a formula?

Removal of any volume of water from beer; filtration of beer to substantially change the color, flavor, or character; separation of beer into different components; reverse osmosis; concentration of beer; and ion exchange treatments are examples of non-traditional processes for which brewers must file a formula.

#### FMB16 : What are examples of traditional processes for which no formula is required?

Pasteurization; filtration prior to bottling; filtration in lieu of pasteurization; centrifuging for clarity; lagering; carbonation; and blending are examples of traditional processes for which brewers do not have to file a formula.

#### FMB17 : What should I do if I'm not sure whether the process used by my brewery requires the filing of a formula?

The appropriate TTB officer may determine whether or not use of a process not listed in [27 CFR § 25.55(a)(1)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25#27:1.0.1.1.20.6.374.4) requires you to file a formula for approval. You may obtain such a determination from TTB by mailing a written request to the Assistant Director, Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 1310 G Street, NW., Box 12 Washington, DC 20005.

#### FMB18 : What information should be included in a request for a determination as to whether use of a process requires the filing of a formula?

The request must include:

- A detailed description of the proposed process;
- Evidence establishing that the proposed process is generally recognized as a traditional process in the production of a fermented beverage designated as "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor"; and
- An explanation of the effect of the proposed process on the production of the fermented product.

#### FMB19 : For what fermented products other than those produced through nontraditional processes must a formula be filed?

In general, formulas must be filed for:

- Any fermented product to which flavors or other nonbeverage ingredients (other than hop extract) containing alcohol will be added;
- Any fermented product to which coloring or natural or artificial flavors will be added;
- Any fermented product to which fruit, fruit juice, fruit concentrate, herbs, spices, honey, maple syrup, or other food materials will be added; and
- Saké, including flavored saké and sparkling saké.

#### FMB20 : Can I file for an exemption from the formula requirement for use of a particular coloring, flavoring, or food material?

Yes. TTB will grant such an exemption upon a finding that the coloring, flavoring, or food material in question is generally recognized as a traditional ingredient in the production of a fermented beverage designated as "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor."

#### FMB21 : How do I file for such an exemption?

Your request should be sent to the Assistant Director, Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 1310 G Street, NW., Box 12 Washington, DC 20005, and must include the following information:

- A description of the proposed ingredient;
- Evidence establishing that the proposed ingredient is generally recognized as a traditional ingredient in the production of a fermented beverage designated as "beer," "ale," "porter," "stout," "lager," or "malt liquor"; and
- An explanation of the effect of the proposed ingredient in the production of a fermented product

#### FMB22 : What are the general requirements for filing a formula?

The requirements are as follows:

- The formula must be filed in writing;
- The formula must identify each brewery where the formula applies by including each brewery name, address, and registry number;
- You must serially number each formula, commencing with number "1" and continuing in numerical sequence;
- You must date and sign each formula; and
- You must file two copies of each formula with TTB.

#### FMB23 : Where do I file a formula?

Your formula should be filed with the Assistant Director, Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, 1310 G Street, NW., Box 12 Washington, DC 20005.

#### FMB24 : What information must appear on each formula?

The following information must appear on each formula:

- You must list each separate ingredient and the specific quantity used, or a range of quantities used.
- You may include optional ingredients if they do not impact the labeling or identity of the finished product.
- For fermented products containing flavorings, the following additional information must appear:

The name of the flavor;

- The product number or TTB drawback number and approval date of the flavor;
- The name and location (city and State) of the flavor manufacturer;
- The alcohol content of the flavor; and
- The point of production at which the flavor was added (that is, before, during or after fermentation).

For formulas that include the use of flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol, you must explicitly indicate:

- The volume and alcohol content of the beer base;
- The maximum volumes of the flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol to be used;
- The alcoholic strength of the flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol;
- The overall alcohol contribution to the finished product provided by the addition of any flavors or other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol; and
- The final volume and alcohol content of the finished product.

#### FMB25 : If I received approval for a beer base formula, should that information be included in the formula?

Yes. You must refer in your formula to any approved formula number that covers the production of a beer base used in producing the formula product. If the beer base was produced by another brewery of the same ownership, you must also provide the name and address or name and registry number of that brewery.

#### FMB26 : What other requirements apply to all formulas?

The formula must also include a detailed description of each process used to produce the fermented beverage. The formula must state the alcohol content of the fermented product after fermentation and the alcohol content of the finished product. Finally, the appropriate TTB officer may at any time require you to file additional information regarding a fermented product, ingredients, or processes, in order to determine whether a formula should be approved or disapproved or whether the approval of a formula should be continued.

#### FMB27 : If my formula includes flavors containing alcohol, am I required to list the alcohol contribution of individual flavors and other nonbeverage ingredients containing alcohol?

No. However, you must state the total alcohol contribution from these ingredients to the finished product.

#### FMB28 : When must I file a new formula (with a new formula number) for approval by TTB?

A new formula must be filed when you –

- Create an entirely new fermented product that requires a formula;
- Add new ingredients to an existing formulation;
- Delete ingredients from an existing formulation;
- Change the quantity of an ingredient used from the quantity or range of usage in an approved formula;
- Change an approved processing, filtration, or other special method of manufacture that requires the filing of a formula; or
- Change the contribution of alcohol from flavors or ingredients that contain alcohol.

#### FMB29 : When may I file a superseding formula instead of a new formula?

You may file a superseding formula instead of a new formula if you change ingredients or processes and these changes would not require a new certificate of label approval. A superseding formula replaces an existing formula, and should be filed only if you do not intend to use the existing formula any more. A superseding formula must be filed with TTB for approval.

#### FMB30 : How does a superseding formula affect the prior formula?

When TTB approves a superseding formula, we will cancel your previous formula.

#### FMB31 : Should the superseding formula use the same formula number as the formula it replaces?

Yes, but you must annotate the formula number to indicate that it is a superseding formula number (For example, "Formula 2, superseding.")

#### FMB32 : Must separate formulas be filed for different products that require a formula?

Yes.

#### FMB33 : May I file a formula for a beer base to be used in the production of one or more other fermented products?

Yes. The base must conform to the standards set forth in 27 CFR § 25.15.

#### FMB34 : When must a formula be filed?

As a general rule, you may not produce a fermented product for which a formula is required until you have filed and received approval of a formula for that product.

#### FMB35 : Is there an exception to the rule regarding prior approval of formulas?

You may, for research and development purposes (including consumer taste testing), produce a fermented product without an approved formula. However, if the product falls into the category of fermented products for which a formula is required, you may not sell or market the product until you receive approval of the formula.

#### FMB36 : How long does my formula approval remain valid?

As a general rule, your approved formula remains in effect until:

- you supsersede it with a new formula;
- you voluntarily surrender the formula;
- TTB cancels or revokes the formula; or
- the formula is revoked by operation of law or regulation.

#### FMB37 : Will statements of process that were approved prior to the effective date of TTB TD-21 remain valid on and after January 3, 2006?

Yes, provided that any finished product that could be made under the statement of process would be in compliance with the provisions [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25), as amended by [TTB TD-21(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2005-01-03/pdf/04-28460.pdf). You do not need to submit a new formula for approval if the product is covered by a statement of process that remains valid.

### Kombucha

#### K1 : What is kombucha?

While there is variation among kombucha products, the term "kombucha" generally refers to a fermented beverage produced from a mixture of steeped tea and sugar, combined with a culture of yeast strains and bacteria. Some kombucha products also have fruit juice or other flavors added during production. The combination of sugar and yeast triggers fermentation, which may produce a kombucha with an alcohol content of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume. When this happens, the kombucha is regulated as an alcohol beverage under federal law and TTB regulations.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K2. Are kombucha products alcohol beverages?

Some kombucha products contain 0.5% or more alcohol by volume. These products are alcohol beverages and are consequently subject to TTB regulations.

It is important to note that regardless of the alcohol content of the finished beverage, when kombucha reaches 0.5% alcohol or more by volume at any time during the production process, it must be produced on a TTB-qualified premises and is subject to TTB regulation.  Thus, for example, a producer of a kombucha-style beer that reaches an alcohol content of 1.2% alcohol by volume during production must qualify as a brewer and comply with TTB regulations in 27 CFR part 25, even if the finished product is a non-alcoholic beverage (containing less than 0.5% alcohol by volume)

For purposes of these FAQs, we are assuming that the kombucha products that we are addressing would derive alcohol primarily from the fermentation of sugar, and, thus would be classified as beer under the IRC and TTB regulations if they contain 0.5% or more alcohol by volume.  See K6 for additional information on how kombucha containing 0.5% or more alcohol by volume is classified under federal law.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K3. What causes a kombucha to continue fermenting in the original container after removal from the producer's premises?

Fermentation, which is part of kombucha production, is a natural reaction when sugar and yeast are combined.  Several factors can influence how much alcohol is produced by fermentation, including time and temperature.

Even though a kombucha beverage may have less than 0.5% alcohol by volume at the time of bottling, fermentation may continue in the bottle after it leaves the production facility, depending on how the kombucha beverage is made and stored.  As a result, the alcohol content may increase to 0.5% or more alcohol by volume. Such a product is an alcohol beverage, which is subject to the laws and regulations governing the production, taxation, labeling, marketing, and distribution of alcohol beverages.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K4. What should I do if I suspect that a kombucha that I purchased contains 0.5% or more alcohol by volume?

Consumers who suspect that a kombucha they bought may actually be an alcohol beverage that has not been produced or labeled in compliance with federal law are encouraged to view our [consumer complaints](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2023) page for suggestions about how to proceed.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K5. What should I do if I'm not sure if the kombucha that I produce contains 0.5% or more alcohol by volume?

Producers who are unsure of the alcohol content of their kombucha may have it tested, using any method that has been formally validated or is otherwise scientifically valid for purposes of determining the alcohol content of beverages, including beverages that contain less than 0.5% alcohol by volume. A scientifically valid method is, among other things, accurate, precise, and specific for its intended purpose, and it has results that are consistently reliable, accurate, and reproducible.

See [Kombucha and Appropriate Alcohol Analysis Testing Methods](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#testing) (K17-K20) for additional information about testing for alcohol content.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K6. How does the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC) classify kombucha that contains 0.5% or more alcohol by volume?

Because “kombucha” does not refer to a recognized classification of alcohol beverage, the classification of kombucha under the IRC depends on its formulation and method of production.  For example, under the IRC, beer may be fermented from malted barley or a substitute for malt, such as sugar.

If the alcohol content of a kombucha is 0.5% or more by volume, and the alcohol is derived from the fermentation of sugar or another appropriate substitute for malt, it will generally be classified as beer under the IRC and TTB regulations at [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a0b7660848f2255a93c154a1639d0fe0&mc=true&node=pt27.1.25&rgn=div5).  For more information on the definition of beer, see [26 U.S.C. 5052(a) (link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=$$xa$$busc26.wais&start=19466994&SIZE=3355&TYPE=TEXT) and [27 CFR 25.15(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a0b7660848f2255a93c154a1639d0fe0&mc=true&node=pt27.1.25&rgn=div5#se27.1.25_115).

It is possible to produce a kombucha-style product that is classified as a wine or distilled spirits product.  However, for purposes of these FAQs, we are assuming that the kombucha products that we are addressing derive alcohol primarily from the fermentation of sugar, and, thus would be classified as beer under the IRC and TTB regulations if they contain 0.5% or more alcohol by volume.

Producers who are unsure of the classification of their kombucha products should submit a written request to TTB’s [Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division](https://www.ttb.gov/node/933).  You should provide a detailed and specific quantitative list of every ingredient used to make the kombucha, as well as a step-by-step description of the entire production process.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K7. May I produce kombucha at a location that is not qualified with TTB for the production of alcohol beverages as long as the finished product contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume?

You may produce such a product without qualifying with TTB as long as the product never reaches 0.5% alcohol by volume or more during production, at the time of bottling, or after removal due to continued fermentation in the container.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K8. What if kombucha contains less than 0.5% alcohol by volume at the time of bottling, but the alcohol content increases to 0.5% or more due to continued fermentation in the bottle?

Such products are alcohol beverages under the IRC and must comply with all the same federal laws and regulations as a kombucha manufactured as an alcohol beverage, including payment of the appropriate federal excise taxes and the requirement to include the [Health Warning Statement](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2022) on the product labels.

If TTB picks up a sample of kombucha in the marketplace and determines that the sample has an alcohol content of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume, TTB will expect the producer to either:

- Take corrective steps, such as adopting a manufacturing method to ensure that fermentation does not continue after bottling; or
- Qualify with TTB as a producer of alcohol beverages.

To avoid potential liability for violations of the IRC and ABLA, a manufacturer of kombucha who is not qualified as a brewer but wishes to produce kombucha as a non-alcoholic beverage should use a method of production that ensures that the alcohol content of the kombucha will not increase after removal from the premises due to continued fermentation in the container.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/22/2015_

#### K9. I produce kombucha that is intended to be kept refrigerated, but it was stored by the retailer in an unrefrigerated area, and the alcohol content increased to 0.5% or more alcohol by volume due to continued fermentation in the bottle. Am I liable for the taxes?

Yes, you are liable for the federal excise taxes on this alcohol beverage, and you may face other liability under federal law.  Refrigeration of the product is not an adequate method of ensuring that the alcohol content will not increase while in the original container after removal because, among other things, you cannot control whether the product will be refrigerated after removal.

If TTB picks up a sample of kombucha in the marketplace and determines that the sample has an alcohol content of 0.5% or more alcohol by volume, TTB will expect the producer to either:

- Take corrective steps, such as adopting a manufacturing method to ensure that fermentation does not continue after bottling; or
- Qualify with TTB as a producer of alcohol beverages.

To avoid potential liability for violations of the IRC and ABLA, a manufacturer of kombucha who is not qualified as a brewer but wishes to produce kombucha as a non-alcoholic beverage should use a method of production that ensures that the alcohol content of the kombucha will not increase after removal from the premises due to continued fermentation in the container.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/22/2015_

#### K10. May I produce kombucha containing 0.5% or more alcohol by volume for my personal or family use without paying federal excise tax?

Yes, if the kombucha is classified as beer. Federal law and TTB regulations allow an adult to produce, without payment of tax, a limited amount of beer for personal or family use and not for sale. The amount produced may not exceed 200 gallons per calendar year for households of two or more adults, or 100 gallons per calendar year if there is only one adult residing in the household. See [Section 5053(e) of the IRC(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=$$xa$$busc26.wais&start=19470355&SIZE=7550&TYPE=TEXT) and [27 CFR 25.205(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=b5cd0ee75ce734970c6231ea770b6d26&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt27.1.25#se27.1.25_1205) for more information about the personal exemption for beer.

Please note that although there is a similar exemption for home production of wine (see [Section 5042(a)(2) of the IRC(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=$$xa$$busc26.wais&start=19443642&SIZE=4459&TYPE=TEXT) and [27 CFR 24.75(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-24#27:1.0.1.1.19.3.284.35)), federal law provides no exemption for the production of distilled spirits for personal use. More information about the prohibition on home distillation is available at our [Home Distilling](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1524) page.

Home producers of beer or wine should also contact [state and local alcohol regulatory authorities](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) to learn about their requirements.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K11. Are kombucha containers required to bear a health warning statement?

Yes, if the kombucha beverage contains 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume. The container of any alcohol beverage sold or distributed in the United States with an alcohol content of 0.5 percent or more must bear the health warning statement required by the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988.  (See [27 U.S.C. 215(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title27/html/USCODE-2011-title27-chap8-subchapII-sec215.htm) and [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a0b7660848f2255a93c154a1639d0fe0&mc=true&node=pt27.1.16&rgn=div5).) This requirement applies regardless of whether the kombucha is subject to the labeling requirements of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act). (See K13.)

See [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=fd8b0ad16b93584273aefb7460a98eb4&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr16_main_02.tpl) for the wording, type size and other formatting rules regarding the health warning statement.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K12. What labeling requirements apply to my kombucha under the IRC?

IRC labeling requirements apply to all kombucha products that contain 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume, regardless of whether the product is also subject to the labeling requirements of the FAA Act.  (See K13.)

If your kombucha is classified as a beer, you must comply with the labeling and marking regulations at [27 CFR 25.141-25.145(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=b5cd0ee75ce734970c6231ea770b6d26&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt27.1.25#sp27.1.25.j), including the requirement that each container must show by label or otherwise:

- The name or trade name of the brewer;
- The net contents of the container;
- The nature of the product (such as “beer”); and
- The place of production.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K13. Does the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), including its additional label requirements, apply to kombucha with an alcohol content of 0.5 percent or more?

The determination of whether a kombucha falls within the classification of a malt beverage, wine, or distilled spirits product under the FAA Act must be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the formulation and method of production.  Products subject to the FAA Act must comply with its labeling and advertising regulations, trade practice rules, and additional qualification requirements.

Some alcohol beverages are subject to tax as beer, but are not subject to the requirements of the FAA Act. For example, beer (other than saké or similar products) that is made without both malted barley and hops is not subject to the labeling requirements of the FAA Act and must instead comply with FDA labeling requirements.  Such products are still subject to the marking requirements of the IRC and the health warning statement requirements of ABLA.

For more information on brewery products not subject to the FAA Act’s labeling and advertising regulations, see [TTB Ruling 2008-3](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2008-3.pdf "2008-3.pdf").

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K14. What requirements apply if the kombucha I produce is classified as beer?

If your kombucha is classified as [beer(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/), you must [qualify as a brewer](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2314) under [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25) and pay appropriate Federal excise taxes. Please refer to [K15](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#k15) and [K16](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#k16) for more information on beer tax rates and qualification as a brewer, respectively.

If we classify your kombucha as beer, you must remove it in a container that complies with the [marking, branding, and labeling requirements(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25/subpart-j) of part 25. (See [K12](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#k12) under [Kombucha Labeling Requirements](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#labeling) for additional information).

Also under part 25 (see [27 CFR 25.55(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=b5cd0ee75ce734970c6231ea770b6d26&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt27.1.25#se27.1.25_155)), a brewer must file a formula with TTB before producing kombucha.

If, based on the submitted formula, we classify your kombucha as a malt beverage (as defined by the FAA Act) your kombucha is also subject to the FAA Act, including the labeling and advertising requirements of [27 CFR part 7(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=d473aa9e89b3f7135e18c8da635f26aa&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr7_main_02.tpl).

In addition, if your kombucha contains 0.5% or more alcohol by volume, your containers must bear the health warning statement, as outlined in [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=fd8b0ad16b93584273aefb7460a98eb4&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr16_main_02.tpl).  See [K11](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#k11) under [Kombucha Labeling Requirements](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#labeling) for more information.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K15. What federal tax applies if my kombucha is classified as beer?

Section 5051 of the IRC imposes a tax on all beer brewed or produced, and removed for consumption or sale, within the United States, or imported into the United States. Under the IRC, a brewer pays taxes on a barrel equivalency, and a barrel (when used as a unit of measurement) is defined as 31 gallons of beer. The rate of tax is $18 per barrel, and a like rate for any other quantity or for fractional parts of a barrel would apply. A reduced rate of $7 a barrel applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale by qualified brewers in the United States who produce not more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer during a calendar year.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K16. How do I qualify as a brewer?

To qualify as a brewer, you must file and receive approval of a [Brewer’s Notice](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2314) and a [bond](https://www.ttb.gov/node/556).  Visit our [Getting Started in the Brewing Industry](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2130) page for more general information.

You also should contact [state and local alcohol regulatory authorities](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1268) to learn about state and local requirements.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K17. Are producers of kombucha beverages required to test the alcohol content of their products?

Brewers qualified by TTB under the IRC are required to maintain records of the alcohol content of their products.  (See [27 CFR 25.293(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=a0b7660848f2255a93c154a1639d0fe0&mc=true&node=pt27.1.25&rgn=div5#se27.1.25_1293).)  Producers of non-alcoholic kombucha products who are not required to qualify with TTB under the IRC are not subject to this requirement.

However, to avoid liability under the IRC and ABLA, kombucha producers should take appropriate steps, including testing of alcohol content, to ensure that the alcohol content of their product does not reach or exceed 0.5 percent alcohol by volume at any time during production, during bottling, or after bottling.

_Last reviewed/updated: 09/17/2015_

#### K18. What testing method is currently in use at the TTB laboratories?

When TTB tests samples of kombucha products from the marketplace to measure the amount of alcohol in the product, it generally uses the headspace gas chromatography-flame ionization detection (headspace GC-FID) method (AOAC reference 2016.12) or the enzymatic method (AOAC reference 2017.07). In the past, TTB also has used the distillation-specific gravity method (AOAC reference 935.21), using a densitometer instead of a pycnometer, which is another scientifically valid method for this purpose.

For information regarding other scientifically valid methods that may be used to test the alcohol content of kombucha beverages, see FAQ K19 below.

_Last reviewed/updated: 08/3/2022_

#### K19. May I use other scientifically valid methods to test the alcohol content of my kombucha beverages?

Yes.  To ensure the reliability of results, producers may use any method that has been formally validated (e.g., that underwent a multi-laboratory performance evaluation) or that is otherwise scientifically valid for purposes of determining the alcohol content of kombucha beverages, including kombucha beverages that contain less than 0.5 percent alcohol by volume.

A scientifically valid method is, among other things, accurate, precise, and specific for its intended purpose, and produces results that are consistently reliable, accurate, and reproducible.

TTB is aware of the following scientifically valid methods that can be used to measure low levels of alcohol in kombucha:

- Headspace GC-FID (AOAC reference 2016.12);
- Headspace Solid Phase Micro Extractions (SPME) GC-MS (AOAC reference 2019.4);
- Distillation-specific gravity method (AOAC reference 935.21), using a densitometer instead of a pycnometer; and
- Two enzymatic methods (AOAC references 2017.07 and 2019.08).

### Alcohol Beverages Containing Added Caffeine

#### CAB1: What Actions Has FDA Taken with Regard to Malt Beverages Containing Added Caffeine?

By letter dated November 17, 2010, FDA advised four industry members that it had reviewed the regulatory status of seven malt beverage products, each of which contains caffeine that has been directly added to an alcohol beverage and packaged in combined caffeine and alcohol form. The FDA letter warned the industry members that as it was used in their products, caffeine is an unsafe food additive, and therefore the products are adulterated under section 402(a)(2)(C) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C). Among other things, the FDA letter stated that "FDA is not aware of any publicly available data to establish affirmatively safe conditions of use for caffeine added directly to alcoholic beverages and packaged in a combined form."

FDA provided these industry members with fifteen (15) days to advise them of the specific steps they have taken to correct the violation identified above and to assure that similar violations do not occur. The FDA letter provided that their responses should include any documentation necessary to show that correction has been achieved. Finally, the FDA letter provided that if the industry members cannot complete all corrections within the 15 days, they should explain the reason for the delay and the date by which each such item will be corrected and documented. The warning letters, as well as other information on the issue of alcohol beverage products containing added caffeine, may be found on the [FDA website(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/default.htm).

#### CAB2: What Actions Has TTB Taken With Regard to the Malt Beverages Identified by FDA as Adulterated?

On November 18, 2010, TTB issued letters to those four industry members regarding the seven malt beverage products that FDA identified in its warning letters as being adulterated. The TTB letters put these companies on notice that FDA's determination that a product is adulterated under the FFDCA would have consequences under the FAA Act, because of TTB's position that adulterated alcohol beverages are mislabeled within the meaning of the FAA Act.

Consistent with the terms of the FDA warning letters, TTB asked that the companies advise TTB within the same 15-day period of the steps that they have taken to correct any violations of the FAA Act and the date by which each violation will be corrected. TTB sent copies of these letters to the brewers who have obtained certificates of label approval from TTB for these products. You can read the TTB letters, along with other TTB guidance on the issue of [alcohol beverage products containing added caffeine](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1918).

#### CAB3: Will TTB Take Enforcement Action with Regard to the Alcohol Beverages that FDA Has Identified as Adulterated?

Consistent with the actions taken by FDA, TTB is not planning to take enforcement action pending expiration of the 15-day period provided to the companies to respond to our letters. At that point, we will evaluate their responses and we will consult with FDA prior to taking enforcement action. It is our expectation that the companies will take voluntary action that will prevent any violations of the FAA Act and will at the same time address the concerns expressed by FDA.

#### CAB4: What are the Consequences under the FAA Act of a Determination that an Alcohol Beverage Product is Adulterated?

It is TTB's position that adulterated malt beverages, distilled spirits, and wines are mislabeled within the meaning of the FAA Act. This means, as explained further below, that the sale or shipment of an adulterated alcohol beverage in interstate or foreign commerce by an industry member subject to the provisions of [27 U.S.C. 205(e)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=83623&SIZE=21170&TYPE=TEXT) constitutes a violation of the FAA Act, even if the bottler or importer of the product in question has obtained a certificate of label approval (COLA) or an approved formula.

Subject to the jurisdictional requirements of the FAA Act, mislabeled distilled spirits, wines, and malt beverages, including adulterated products, may not be sold or shipped, delivered for sale or shipment, or otherwise introduced or received in interstate or foreign commerce, or removed from customs custody for consumption, by a producer, importer, or wholesaler, or other industry member subject to [27 U.S.C. 205(e)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=83623&SIZE=21170&TYPE=TEXT). TTB may pursue action to suspend or to revoke the FAA Act basic permit of industry members who willfully violate the conditions of their permit with respect to mislabeled, adulterated products. See [27 U.S.C. 204(e)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=72288&SIZE=11329&TYPE=TEXT). Violations of the labeling provisions of the FAA Act are punishable as misdemeanors and the Government may seek injunctive relief to prevent and restrain such violations. TTB also may seek an offer in compromise covering the liability arising with respect to such violations in the sum of not more than $500 for each offense. See [27 U.S.C. 207(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=107848&SIZE=4960&TYPE=TEXT). Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, TTB officers may, in appropriate circumstances, temporarily detain any alcohol beverage container that is being removed in violation of law, or seek a voluntary detention agreement with the industry member. See [26 U.S.C. 5311(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc26.wais&start=19872015&SIZE=1944&TYPE=TEXT).

#### CAB5: What if I Have Obtained a COLA or Formula Approval for My Alcohol Beverage?

TTB reminds you that each producer and importer of alcohol beverages is responsible for ensuring that the ingredients in its products comply with the laws and regulations that FDA administers. TTB's approval of a COLA or formula does not imply or otherwise constitute a determination that the product complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&CA), including a determination as to whether the product is adulterated because it contains an unapproved food additive. Subject to the jurisdictional requirements of the FAA Act, mislabeled distilled spirits, wines, and malt beverages, including adulterated products, may not be sold or shipped, delivered for sale or shipment, or otherwise introduced or received in interstate or foreign commerce, or removed from customs custody for consumption, by a producer, importer, or wholesaler, or other industry member subject to 27 U.S.C. 205(e), even if the bottler or importer of the product in question has obtained a COLA or an approved formula.

#### CAB6: How do TTB and FDA Interact with Regard to Adulterated Alcohol Beverages?

While TTB regulates the labeling of alcohol beverages pursuant to the FAA Act, it is FDA's responsibility to evaluate the safety of ingredients added to alcohol beverages, pursuant to FDA's authority under the FFDCA. TTB operates under a 1987 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with FDA that clarifies and delineates the enforcement responsibilities of each agency with respect to alcohol beverages that may be adulterated under the FFDCA and establishes procedures for coordination between the two agencies. The MOU acknowledges that TTB is the agency with a system of specific statutory and regulatory controls over alcohol beverages and that FDA has authority regarding determinations regarding the safety of food additives used in the production of alcohol beverages and over making determinations about when an alcohol beverage is considered adulterated.

#### CAB7: Is TTB Sharing Information with FDA About Alcohol Beverages Containing Added Caffeine?

Yes. TTB will continue to coordinate with FDA on this matter that affects issues within the jurisdiction of both agencies. TTB has already shared information with FDA regarding approved labels for alcohol beverages containing added caffeine, and we will continue to do so, as needed. In addition, upon receipt of a formal request from FDA, we will provide information to FDA about formulas for beers containing added caffeine that are approved under [27 CFR Part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-25). This disclosure will be made pursuant to our authority under [26 U.S.C. 6103(o)(1)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc26.wais&start=21221927&SIZE=259305&TYPE=TEXT) to share return information with employees of a Federal agency whose official duties require such disclosure. Such a disclosure is contingent upon an agreement by FDA to safeguard the confidentiality of this information.

#### CAB8: Will TTB Continue to Approve Labels or Formulas for Alcohol Beverages Containing Added Caffeine?

TTB urges all industry members to carefully consider their responsibilities to comply with the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&CA) and to consult with FDA regarding the [General Recognized As Safe (GRAS)(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/food/ingredientspackaginglabeling/gras/default.htm) status of their intended use of caffeine prior to submitting any such applications to TTB.

#### CAB9: Will TTB Take Action with Regard to Approved Labels or Formulas for Alcohol Beverages Containing Added Caffeine?

TTB is reviewing all approved formulas and labels for such products and will consult with FDA prior to taking action with regard to approved labels or formulas. We encourage all industry members who have received approvals from TTB and who have reason to believe that their products may not be in compliance with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&CA).

#### CAB10: Does the Return of Alcohol Beverages Containing Added Caffeine by a Retailer or Wholesaler Violate the FAA Act's Prohibitions Against Consignment Sales?

No. Among other things, the FAA Act's prohibitions against consignment sales apply only to the conditions agreed to at the time of a sale. Furthermore, these prohibitions do not apply to transactions involving solely the bona fide return of merchandise for ordinary and usual commercial reasons arising after the merchandise has been sold. See [27 U.S.C. 205(d)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=83623&SIZE=21170&TYPE=TEXT). The regulations at [27 CFR Part 11, Subpart D(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-11#27:1.0.1.1.9.4) set forth several examples of "ordinary and usual commercial reasons" that may arise after the product has been sold, including a situation in which products may no longer be lawfully sold. See [27 CFR 11.34(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-11#27:1.0.1.1.9.4.43.4). The actions of a retailer or wholesaler in returning to an industry member alcohol beverages containing added caffeine, after the sale of the product, for cash or credit against outstanding indebtedness, due to concerns about the legal status of such products under Federal, State, or local law, would not violate the consignment sales provisions of [27 U.S.C. 205(d)(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=RETRIEVE&FILE=%24%24xa%24%24busc27.wais&start=83623&SIZE=21170&TYPE=TEXT). Of course, the regulations do not mandate that the industry member accept such a return. See [27 CFR 11.31(b)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-11#27:1.0.1.1.9.4.43.1).

#### CAB11: What if My Alcohol Beverage Product Contains Caffeine But I Did Not Receive a Warning Letter from FDA?

Industry members should contact FDA with all inquiries as to the GRAS\* status of ingredients added to alcohol beverages. TTB will continue to coordinate with FDA on this matter.

#### ECP3: How do I obtain an export certificate from TTB for wines, beer/malt beverages, or distilled spirits exported outside of the United States?

TTB's [Export Documents/Certificates](https://www.ttb.gov/node/776) webpage provides detailed information about obtaining a paper export certificate from TTB.

- **For Certificates of Free Sale, Origin and/or Age, Manufacturing, Health, Sanitation, Authenticity, Sanitary Statements/Certificates**, and any other certificate that an exporting country requires to be submitted on company letterhead, please use the provided [export certificate template](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/export-certificate-template.pdf "export-certificate-template.pdf").
- **For U.S. wine exported to the European Union (EU)**, the EU requires that your shipment be accompanied by either a simplified export certificate, which is not submitted to TTB for processing, or a VI-1 Long Form (see [Wine Exports to the European Union](https://www.ttb.gov/node/776) for additional information).
- **For U.S. wine exported to economies within the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) region**, with the exception of China, you may consider using the [APEC Model Wine Certificate](https://www.ttb.gov/node/2444), which includes instructions on completing the certificate. (See below for information on the export certificate accepted by China). This certificate is a consolidation of various export certificates, which includes the Certificate of Authenticity/Free Sale, Certificate of Health/Sanitation, and Certificate of Origin. APEC is comprised of 21 economies: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the People’s Republic of China (China), Peru, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Philippines, the Russian Federation, Singapore, Thailand, the United States of America, and Vietnam. The use and scope of the certificate is at the discretion of the importing APEC economy. For instance, Thailand requires that importers complete the APEC Model Wine Certificate in a particular format, (see [APEC Wine Certificate for Thailand](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/itd/export-certificate-thailand-apec-model-wine.docx "export-certificate-thailand-apec-model-wine.docx") for template) otherwise importers must submit samples of their products to Thailand's Excise Department for analysis. Please contact your importer to ensure that the authorities of the importing economy will accept this certificate in lieu of pre-existing requirements.
- **For U.S. wine exported to China**, you may submit the [consolidated wine export certificate](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1754). The certificate incorporates three certificates (Certificate of Origin, Certificate of Health/Sanitation, and Certificate of Authenticity/Free Sale) in one document. If you need a Certificate of Bottling, it must be submitted separately using the [export certificate template](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/export-certificate-template.pdf "export-certificate-template.pdf"). **Please use the APEC Model Wine Certificate for wine exports to Hong Kong or Taiwan.**
- For distilled spirits only:
  - Use [TTB Form 5110.58](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f511058.pdf "f511058.pdf") for the Certificate of Origin and Age for Distilled Spirits, if appropriate.
  - Use [TTB Form 5110.42](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f511042.pdf "f511042.pdf") for the Certificate of Authenticity Bourbon Whisky.

Exporters may also use TTB’s electronic export certificate system to prepare their export certificate, if it is accepted by the destination country.

#### ECP5: Does each alcohol beverage need an individual export certificate?

Generally, each shipment should have a separate export certificate. Typically, one certificate can cover several different products, as long as they are in the same shipment.

Our [Import/Export Requirements Guide](https://www.ttb.gov/itd/interre1.shtml) offers exporters information on some countries’ import requirements for wine, beer/malt beverages, and distilled spirits, including certification requirements for certain countries that may vary from the general guidance above. Exporters should always contact the responsible foreign agencies (located in the Contacts section of each country page) to verify that the information listed is [current](https://www.ttb.gov/node/25317 "ECP10: What can I do to ensure that my paper export certificates will be processed by TTB as quickly as possible?").

#### ECP6: I am exporting wine to the European Union (EU). What type of certificates are required?

U.S. wine exported to the EU must be accompanied by either a [simplified export certificate](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/industry_circulars/archives/2007/attachment09-02.pdf "attachment09-02.pdf") or a VI-1 form for each type and/or lot of grape wine.

EU Simplified Export Certificate (self-certifying)

- Producing wineries that are also the exporter may use the [simplified export certificate](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/industry_circulars/archives/2007/attachment09-02.pdf "attachment09-02.pdf"), which only requires one chemical analysis of the wine (actual alcohol content) and is self-certified by the exporter. (See [TTB Industry Circular 2007-02](https://www.ttb.gov/images/industry_circulars/archives/2007/07-02.html) for additional information, including a sample certificate.)

The EU VI-1 forms certify that the wine exported (1) complies with the conditions governing the production and entry into circulation applicable in the United States of America, (2) has not been subjected to enological practices which are not permitted under current European Economic Community provisions, and (3) has been produced by a winery licensed by TTB for the production of grape wine. The winery must also send Attachment III (certification statement) along with the shipment. Detailed information concerning the VI-1 form can be found in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 555/2008 of 27 June 2008. This regulation, along with attached VI1 forms, can be found [here(link is external)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/4ed052a7-bebe-4b43-b369-445b832e2264/language-en__;!!OsxilXc!q9bHOeY7ptf1RJ0ephICYnVDhjLcXJbBjj4hdZyX7QrBliFuZ-G3W7sQEXQ5l_1Ej6E6SeINHiEzlrTUTh5rgrOSOo8kN5PkKw4$).

EU VI-1 Short Form (self-certifying)

- Producing wineries that are also the exporter may use the VI-1 short form once they are added to the official EU list of self-certifying wineries published in the [EU Official Journal(link is external)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/oj/direct-access.html). To be added to the EU list, the producing winery must first fill out an Attachment IV certification statement and submit the completed form to TTB using the IAD [contact form](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-iad), selecting “Export Certificates” as your reason for inquiry. TTB provides the EU with any new submissions twice a year, in March and September. Once a winery has been added to the EU’s official list, they may begin using the VI-1 short form for exports to the EU.

EU VI-1 Long Form

- **Wholesale Basic Permit Holders**, which are not the producer of the wine (producing winery), must use the VI-1 Long Form. The Long Form also may be used by any U.S. exporter (i.e., producing wineries and/or wholesale basic permit holders).

For a list of EU Member Countries and State(s), please see [https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries\_en(link is external)](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en).

The United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland) left the EU on January 31, 2020, but it continues to use EU forms and procedures. For the latest information on exporting wine to the United Kingdom, please see [Importing and exporting wine - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)(link is external)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.gov.uk/guidance/importing-and-exporting-wine__;!!OsxilXc!q9bHOeY7ptf1RJ0ephICYnVDhjLcXJbBjj4hdZyX7QrBliFuZ-G3W7sQEXQ5l_1Ej6E6SeINHiEzlrTUTh5rgrOSOo8kCwSdomg$).

#### ECP7: I need a chemical analysis of the product. Where can I find a list of approved chemists?

You can find a list of chemists certified by TTB for the analysis of exported alcohol products on our [Chemist Certification Program Information](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/chemist-certification-program) Web page.

#### ECP8: What is an apostille and how do I obtain one?

An apostille is a certificate issued by a designated authority in a country where the [Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement for Legalization of Foreign Public Documents (Convention)(link is external)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/conventions/status-table/?cid=41__;!!OsxilXc!q9bHOeY7ptf1RJ0ephICYnVDhjLcXJbBjj4hdZyX7QrBliFuZ-G3W7sQEXQ5l_1Ej6E6SeINHiEzlrTUTh5rgrOSOo8kCt4AZF4$) is in force. Some countries may request an apostille to authenticate the seals and signatures of officials on public documents so that they can be recognized in foreign countries that are parties to the Convention.

In the United States, federal executive branch documents are authenticated by the [U.S. Department of State Office of Authentications(link is external)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/office-of-authentications.html__;!!OsxilXc!q9bHOeY7ptf1RJ0ephICYnVDhjLcXJbBjj4hdZyX7QrBliFuZ-G3W7sQEXQ5l_1Ej6E6SeINHiEzlrTUTh5rgrOSOo8k13wQ8Jw$). The Office of Authentications completes apostilles for documents signed by TTB, such as export certificates.

The exporter will need to first obtain the export certificate from TTB and then submit the certificate processed by TTB to the Office of Authentications for an apostille.

Details on the apostille process are available at [Office of Authentications (state.gov)(link is external)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/authenticate-your-document/office-of-authentications.html__;!!OsxilXc!q9bHOeY7ptf1RJ0ephICYnVDhjLcXJbBjj4hdZyX7QrBliFuZ-G3W7sQEXQ5l_1Ej6E6SeINHiEzlrTUTh5rgrOSOo8k13wQ8Jw$).

#### ECP9: Can I submit requests for export certificates electronically?

Yes, we prefer that you use TTB’s electronic export certificate system at [myTTB](https://my.ttb.gov/) to prepare and manage your export certificates.

You also may submit paper export certificate requests using the IAD [contact form](https://www.ttb.gov/contact-iad), selecting “Export Certificates” as your reason for inquiry. Please see [ECP10](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#ecp10) on ways to avoid delays and ensure your request is processed as quickly as possible.

#### ECP10: What can I do to ensure that my paper export certificates will be processed by TTB as quickly as possible?

You can help us process your export certificate request expeditiously by following these tips:

- **Permit** \- Please ensure that the correct TTB permit, registry, or brewer’s notice number is provided on the certificate for the company listed. See ECP2 on how to obtain a permit, registry, or brewer’s notice number.
- **Signature** \- If using [TTB’s export certificate template](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/export-certificate-template.pdf "export-certificate-template.pdf"), please ensure both pages in the template are signed.
  - Include the typed name and position of the person signing the document after or below the signature on certificates submitted on your company’s letterhead.
  - o Ensure that the person signing the export certificate request has signing authority or power of attorney for the company on file with TTB. This is the most common reason for delay.
  - o The Certificate of Origin and Analysis must include the chemist’s printed or typed name below the signature so that we can verify that the chemist is a [TTB-certified chemist](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/chemist-certification-program).
- **Type of Certificate**\- Please use the appropriate export certificate template provided on the TTB export documents webpage, unless otherwise required by the importing country.
  - Fill in all of the requested information in the template.
  - The premise address listed on the export certificate must match the address on file with your permit with TTB. If your premise address has changed, you must apply for and receive an approved amended permit prior to conducting operations.

### Serving Facts Statements

#### SF1: What is the effect of TTB Ruling 2013-2?

This ruling modifies and amplifies [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") to permit the use of optional Serving Facts statements on labels and in advertisements.

#### SF2: Is the use of a Serving Facts statement mandatory or optional?

It is optional. You may use a Serving Facts statement on any label or advertisement, and you may choose to use a Serving Facts statement in lieu of a statement of average analysis when making calorie or carbohydrate claims on labels or in advertisements. See question 4 for additional information about using a Serving Facts statement on labels with calorie or carbohydrate claims.

#### SF3: May I use a Serving Facts statement or a statement of average analysis on a label or in an advertisement that does not make any other calorie or carbohydrate claims?

Yes.

#### SF4: May I make a low-calorie claim on a label that does not include either a statement of average analysis or a Serving Facts statement?

No. It has been the longstanding position of TTB and its predecessor agency that any caloric or carbohydrate statement or representation in the labeling and advertising of wines, distilled spirits, and malt beverages will be viewed as misleading unless it provides complete information about the calorie, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content of the product. As set forth in [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf"), a statement of average analysis, which includes information about calories, carbohydrates, protein and fat content on a per-serving basis, ensured that such labels or advertisements did not mislead consumers.

[TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf") does not change that position. Instead, it offers industry members an additional option in providing consumers with information about the nutrient and alcohol content of the product. TTB will view labels and advertisements as misleading if they make claims about the calorie or carbohydrate content of the product unless they include either a statement of average analysis in accordance with TTB Ruling 2004-1 or a Serving Facts statement that complies with the requirements of TTB Ruling 2013-2. Thus, a Serving Facts statement may now be used on such labels instead of a statement of average analysis.

#### SF5: I've been using a statement of average analysis on my "light" beer labels for years. May I continue to do so?

Yes. Statements of average analysis that comply with the requirements of [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") may continue to be used on labels and in advertisements.

#### SF6: What is a Serving Facts statement?

A Serving Facts statement includes the serving size, the number of servings per container, and the number of calories and the number of grams of carbohydrates, protein, and fat, per serving size. In addition, you may choose to include the percentage of alcohol by volume in the statement, and if you do so, you may also include the number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving as part of the alcohol by volume statement.

#### SF7: May I use a Serving Facts statement on a keg?

Yes. The labeling provisions of TTB Rulings [2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf") and [2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") apply to all containers used for the sale of wines, distilled spirits, or malt beverages at retail, including kegs.

#### SF8: My malt beverages have a brand name that includes the term "light." However, in my advertisements, I make no other claims about nutrients (such as calories, carbohydrates, protein or fat). Am I required to place a Serving Facts statement or a statement of average analysis on these advertisements?

No. If your advertisement does not make any other claim about the nutrient content of the product, you are not required to place a Serving Facts statement or a statement of average analysis on the advertisement. However, labels for products including terms such as "light" in their brand names will not be approved without a statement of average analysis or a Serving Facts statement, unless the term "light" is used in a way that clearly does not refer to nutrient content.

#### SF9: If I wish to place a Serving Facts statement on my label or in my advertisement, should I provide information based on a serving or on the entire container?

A Serving Facts statement appearing on a label or in an advertisement may be stated per container size only if the container is equal to or less than a single serving size. However, as an option, the Serving Facts statement may be presented in a dual-column format, which provides information both per serving size and per container size.

Otherwise, the Serving Facts statement must be stated per serving size, and must specify the serving size as part of the statement. Serving sizes for purposes of Serving Facts labeling are specified in the chart below. These serving sizes must also be used when calculating the number of servings per container, which should be rounded to the nearest quarter of a serving. For example, a malt beverage with an alcohol content of 5 percent alcohol by volume in a can that contains 16 fl.oz. should be labeled as containing 1 ¼ 12 fl.oz. servings.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serving Size | Alcohol Percent by Volume |
| Wine | Distilled Spirits | Malt Beverages |
| 1.5 fl oz (44 ml), or 50 ml for 50 ml containers of distilled spirits |  | Above 24% | Above 24% |
| 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) | Above 16 to 24% | Above 16 to 24% | Above 16 to 24% |
| 5 fl oz (148 ml) | 7 to 16% | Above 7 to 16% | Above 7 to 16% |
| 12 fl oz (355 ml) |  | Not more than 7% | Not more than 7% |

#### SF10: Do I need to submit a new application for label approval if the only change to my label is to include either a Serving Facts statement or a statement of average analysis?

If an approved label is being changed only to include a statement of average analysis in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") or a Serving Facts statement in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"), and the format for the Serving Facts statement is one that is depicted in the examples provided in the attachment to TTB Ruling 2013-2, the submission of a new application for a certificate of label approval (COLA) is not necessary.

#### SF11: Do I need to submit a new application for label approval if my approved label includes a statement of average analysis, but I want to remove that statement and replace it with a Serving Facts statement in one of the formats set out in the attachment to TTB Ruling 2013-2?

No. You may make that change without submitting a new application for label approval.

#### SF12: May I add a Serving Facts statement to my approved label and also make additional changes without submitting a new application for label approval?

You may add a Serving Facts statement to your approved label as permitted in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"), and you may also make additional changes as permitted in accordance with the instructions for the COLA application form, [TTB F 5100.31](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") (which also appear on COLAs Online for electronic submitters), without having to submit a new application for label approval. If the additional changes are not covered by the instructions on the COLA application form, you must submit a new application for label approval. Get a complete list of allowable changes and learn more about [what changes can be made to an approved label](https://www.ttb.gov/news/allowable-changes-label-generator).

#### SF13: Am I required to use a panel for the Serving Facts statement, or may I present this information in a linear display?

The attachment to [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf") provides examples of both a panel display and a linear display. You may choose whichever display fits best on your label or advertisement.

#### SF14: May I include a Serving Facts statement on my label in a format that is different from the examples set forth in TTB Ruling 2013-2?

You must submit a new application for label approval if you wish to use a format that differs from the examples set forth in the attachment to [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"). Other formats for this type of information will be considered on a case-by-case basis. In considering other formats, TTB will take into consideration whether a proliferation of formats might tend to confuse consumers.

#### SF15: May I include a Serving Facts statement on my label or in my advertisement without including information about the alcohol content of the product in the Serving Facts statement?

Yes. Serving Facts statements may include information about the alcohol content of the product on an optional basis. However, industry members may choose to not include alcohol content in the Serving Facts statement. An example of this format is set out in the attachment to [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf").

#### SF16: May I include the percentage of alcohol by volume on my Serving Facts statement without including a statement of the fluid ounces of alcohol per serving?

Yes. Alcohol content may be presented in the Serving Facts statement as a percentage of alcohol by volume. In addition, if alcohol content is expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, the Serving Facts statement may also include a statement of the fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth) as part of the alcohol by volume statement. However, industry members may choose to include the percentage of alcohol by volume in the Serving Facts statement without including a statement of the number of fluid ounces of alcohol per serving.

#### SF17: The regulations require that certain products must include an alcohol content statement on the brand label. If I include an optional alcohol content statement as part of a Serving Facts statement for such products on a label other than the brand label, am I required to repeat the alcohol content statement on the brand label?

Yes. The inclusion of an optional alcohol content statement as part of a Serving Facts statement does not excuse industry members from compliance with existing regulations regarding the placement of mandatory alcohol content statements. The regulations require an alcohol content statement on the brand label for all distilled spirits and for those malt beverages containing alcohol derived from added flavors or other added nonbeverage ingredients (other than hops extract) containing alcohol. However, alcohol content statements may appear in more than one place on the container, provided that they are consistent and in compliance with all regulatory requirements. The percentage of alcohol by volume for wine containers may appear on any label.

#### SF18: I would like to add a Serving Facts statement to my approved label without submitting a new COLA application. May I use abbreviations for the terms used in the optional Serving Facts statement, or must I use the exact terms set forth in the examples?

The following abbreviations may be used on labels and in advertisements bearing the optional Serving Facts statement, with or without periods after the abbreviations:

(1) For "Alcohol by volume," the abbreviations "Alc/vol" or "Alc by vol";

(2) For U.S. fluid ounces, "fl oz";

(3) For calories, "Cal";

(4) For grams, "g";

(5) For Carbohydrate, "Carb";

(6) For serving (except in the title "Serving Facts"), "Serv";

(7) For milliliter, "ml"; and

(8) For amount, "Amt."

#### SF19: May I place the optional Serving Facts statement on my product's neck label?

You may include the optional Serving Facts statement on any label on the container, including a strip or neck label.

#### SF20: Are there type size or font requirements for Serving Facts statements?

There are no specific type size or font requirements for the optional Serving Facts statement on labels or in advertisements. However, the statement should be on a contrasting background and should be readily legible under ordinary circumstances.

### Sugar Content Statements

#### SUG1: May I provide information about the number of grams, per serving, of sugar in my product on my label or in my advertisement?

Truthful, accurate, and non-misleading numerical statements about the sugar content of a product are permitted on alcohol beverage labels and in advertisements. Sugar is a type of carbohydrate, so a sugar content statement is a carbohydrate claim and must be made in accordance with the guidance set forth for carbohydrate representations in [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/media/72022/download?inline) and [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/media/72036/download?inline). Also see [TTB Ruling 2020-1](https://www.ttb.gov/laws-regulations-and-public-guidance/rulings/r2020-1), Expanded Tolerances for Voluntary Calorie Statements in the Labeling and Advertising of Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages.

Accordingly, a truthful, accurate, and non-misleading numerical statement about the sugar content of a product may appear on a label or in an advertisement if the label or advertisement also bears either a statement of average analysis in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/media/72022/download?inline) or a Serving Facts statement in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/media/72036/download?inline) and the serving size on which the sugar content statement is based is consistent with the applicable serving size under those rulings.

Numerical sugar content claims should be made in accordance with the guidance set forth in [TTB Procedure 2020-1](https://www.ttb.gov/laws-regulations-and-public-guidance/procedures/ttb-guidance-procedures-2020-1) with regard to carbohydrate content statements. Thus, the number of grams (g) of sugar in a serving must be expressed to the nearest tenth of a gram, except that if a serving contains less than 1 gram, the statement "Contains less than 1 gram (g)" or "less than 1 gram (g)" may be used as an alternative. If the serving contains less than 0.5 g of sugar, the content may be expressed as zero (or 0) grams (g).

#### SUG2: May my label or advertisement include a claim such as "Zero Sugar," "No Sugar," or "Sugar Free," if the product contains less than 0.5 g of sugar per serving?

Yes, if a serving contains less than 0.5 g of sugar, you may include a claim such as "Zero Sugar," "No Sugar," or "Sugar Free." Such claims must be made in accordance with the guidance set forth for carbohydrate representations in [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") and [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"), which provides that the label or advertisement must also include either a statement of average analysis in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2004-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2004-1.pdf "2004-1.pdf") or a Serving Facts statement in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"). The serving size on which the sugar content statement is based must be consistent with the applicable serving size under those rulings.

#### SUG3: What is meant by sugars on an alcohol beverage label or advertisement?

For purpose of this guidance, the term "sugars" refers to the sum of free monosaccharides and disaccharides in the beverage. To calculate sugars, you must determine the weight in grams per serving of all free monosaccharides and disaccharides in the beverage sample. Do not include any artificial or natural no-calorie sweeteners in your calculation.

TTB generally monitors compliance of labeling and advertising claims by using appropriate methods found in the Official Methods of Analysis of the AOAC International (AOAC International, Gaithersburg, MD).

#### SUG4: Does this guidance apply to labeling claims indicating a higher sugar content for the grapes used in wine that are made in accordance with ATF Ruling 82-4 and ATF Ruling 78-4?

This guidance does not apply to wine labels bearing a descriptive term (such as "Late Harvest") that is intended to indicate a higher sugar content for the grapes used in the wine. TTB allows the use of certain descriptive terms relating to the sugar content of grapes provided that the amount of sugar contained in the grapes at the time of harvest and the amount of residual sugar in the finished wine are stated on the label, in compliance with the provisions of [ATF Ruling 78-4](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/78-4.htm) and [ATF Ruling 82-4](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/82-4.htm). Such statements are not required to be accompanied by a statement of average analysis or a Serving Facts statement, and you should refer to [ATF Ruling 78-4](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/78-4.htm) and [ATF Ruling 82-4](https://www.ttb.gov/images/pdfs/rulings/82-4.htm) for guidance on use of this type of statement.

#### SUG5: May I include health claims on labels and advertisements suggesting that my sugar-free alcohol beverage is appropriate for persons suffering from certain diseases or health-related conditions?

TTB reminds industry members that due to the health risks posed by alcohol consumption, sugar content is not the only factor in determining whether an alcohol beverage is appropriate for consumption by persons suffering from health-related conditions. Statements, symbols, vignettes, or other forms of labeling or advertising statements that expressly, or by implication, characterize the relationship of the product, or the sugar content of the product, to a disease or health-related condition are prohibited unless such statements comply with the requirements for specific health claims as set forth in the TTB regulations. See 27 CFR [4.39(h)(2)(ii)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#p-4.39(h)), [4.64(i)(2)(ii)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#p-4.64(i)), [5.129(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5#5.129), [5.235(d)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5#p-5.235(d)), [7.129(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#7.129), and [7.235(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#p-7.235(e)).

### Alcohol Facts Statements

#### AF1: May I provide per-serving alcohol content information on my label or in my advertisement without providing nutrient content information?

Yes. If your label or advertisement does not include any nutrient content statements or claims, you may provide the same truthful and accurate per-serving alcohol content information that is allowed as part of a Serving Facts statement under [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"). This information should be provided under the heading "Alcohol Facts," to distinguish it from a "Serving Facts" statement, and must include the serving size (in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf")), the number of servings per container, and the percentage of alcohol by volume together with a numerical statement of the number of fluid ounces of pure ethyl alcohol per serving (rounded to the nearest tenth). If you wish to make any type of nutrient content statement or claim on the label or advertisement, along with optional per-serving alcohol content information, you should use a Serving Facts statement in accordance with [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf").

#### AF2: What serving sizes must I use if I include an Alcohol Facts statement on my label or in my advertisement?

Serving sizes for purposes of Alcohol Facts labeling must be consistent with the sizes set forth in [TTB Ruling 2013-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2013-2.pdf "2013-2.pdf"), and are specified in the chart below.

|     |     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serving Size | Alcohol Percent by Volume |
| Wine | Distilled Spirits | Malt Beverages |
| 1.5 fl oz (44 ml), or 50 ml for 50 ml containers of distilled spirits |  | Above 24% | Above 24% |
| 2.5 fl oz (74 ml) | Above 16 to 24% | Above 16 to 24% | Above 16 to 24% |
| 5 fl oz (148 ml) | 7 to 16% | Above 7 to 16% | Above 7 to 16% |
| 12 fl oz (355 ml) |  | Not more than 7% | Not more than 7% |

#### AF3: How do I calculate the number of servings per container?

The number of servings per container is calculated by dividing the total net contents by the serving size as specified by **AF2**. The number of servings in a container must be rounded to the nearest quarter of a serving. Examples of determining the number of servings per container are shown below.

_**16 fluid ounce can of beer at 12 percent alcohol by volume:**_

- Alc. by vol.: 12%
- Total net contents:  16 fl. oz.
- Serving size:  5 fl. oz.

Servings per container:  16 fl. oz. ÷ 5 fl. oz. = 3.20 rounded to the nearest quarter of a serving = **3 1/4** servings per container.

_**1 liter bottle of distilled spirits at 40 percent alcohol by volume**_

- Alc. by vol.: 40%
- Total net contents: 1 Liter (1000 ml)
- Serving size:  1.5 fl. oz. (44 ml)

Servings per container:  1000 ml ÷ 44 ml = 22.73 rounded to the nearest quarter of a serving = **22 3/4** servings per container

_**750 ml bottle of wine at 13.5 percent alcohol by volume**_

- Alc. by vol. 13.5%
- Total net contents: 750 ml
- Serving size: 5 fl. oz. (148 ml)

Servings per container:  750 ml ÷ 148 ml = 5.07 rounded to the nearest quarter of a serving = **5** servings per container

#### AF4: How do I calculate the fluid ounces of alcohol per serving?

The number of fluid ounces of alcohol per serving is calculated by multiplying the number of fluid ounces in a serving by the percentage of alcohol by volume and rounding to the nearest tenth of a fluid ounce. Examples are set forth below:

_Wine at 14 percent alcohol by volume_

_Serving size:_ **5 fl. oz.** _Alcohol by volume:_ **14% (or 0.14)**

_Fl.  oz. of alcohol per serving:_ **5 x 0.14 = 0.7 fl. oz. of alcohol per serving**

_Malt beverage at 4 percent alcohol by volume_

_Serving size:_ **12 fl. oz.** _Alcohol by volume:_ **4% (or 0.04)**

_Fl.  oz. of alcohol per serving:_ **12 x 0.04 = 0.48 fl. oz. of alcohol per serving (rounded to 0.5)**

_Distilled spirits at 40 percent alcohol by volume_

_Serving size:_ **1.5 fl. oz.** _Alcohol by volume:_ **40% (or 0.4)**

_Fl. oz. of alcohol per serving:_ **1.5 x 0.4 = 0.6 fl. oz. of alcohol per serving**

#### AF5: May the "Alcohol Facts" statement be stated per container size?

An Alcohol Facts statement appearing on a label or an advertisement may be stated per container size only if the container size is equal to or less than a single serving size. However, as an option, the Alcohol Facts statement may be presented in a format that provides information both per serving size and per container size.

#### AF6: Is there a minimum type size for Alcohol Facts statements?

Generally, there are no minimum type size requirements for Alcohol Facts statements; however, the information should be readily legible and appear on a contrasting background. If it is being used to satisfy an alcohol content statement requirement on labels or in advertisements, it must meet the type size and placement requirements for that information.

#### AF7: Does the inclusion of an "Alcohol Facts" statement on my label satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements for an alcohol content statement?

The TTB [labeling regulations](https://www.ttb.gov/node/869) require an alcohol content statement, expressed as a percentage of alcohol by volume, for certain products. Because the Alcohol Facts statement includes a statement of the percentage of alcohol by volume, it will satisfy those requirements as long as it complies with the placement and type size requirements set forth in the regulations.

#### AF8: Must I submit a new application for label approval if I want to add an "Alcohol Facts" statement to my approved label?

No, if an approved label is being changed only to include an Alcohol Facts statement following the guidelines in these FAQs, and the format used is one that is depicted in the examples provided in AF9, the submission of a new application for label approval is not necessary.

#### AF9: What are examples of acceptable Alcohol Facts statements?

Examples of acceptable Alcohol Facts statements are depicted below. If one of these formats is used, the submission of a new COLA application for the sole reason of including this additional information is unnecessary.

- The following Alcohol Facts statement illustrates an acceptable panel display for a 750 milliliter bottle of wine containing 14 percent alcohol by volume.

- The following Alcohol Facts statement illustrates an acceptable display for a 16 fluid ounce malt beverage bottle containing 8 percent alcohol by volume and includes information about the fluid ounces of alcohol per bottle.

![Alcohol Facts](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/2024-06/alcoholfacts4.png)

#### AF10: Will TTB consider other formats for Alcohol Facts information?

Other formats for per-serving alcohol content information will be considered on a case-by-case basis and will necessitate the submission of a new COLA application.

### Extraction Products

#### EP1: What are extraction products?

While there is some variation in production methods, extraction products are generally produced by steeping herbs, flowers, gems, or minerals in water, which is used as an extracting agent. The steeping process is believed to extract various elements from the steeped material which are beneficial to the user of the extraction product. The herbs, flowers, gems, or minerals are removed after steeping, and alcohol, usually vodka or brandy, is added to the water as a preservative. In some cases, alcohol may be used as the extracting agent. Extraction products are generally sold as sprays or drops, usually in one or two ounce containers. These products are generally marketed, advertised, and labeled as "essences," but they are not the same as fruit or other essences that are commercially produced and intended for use as flavorings for alcohol beverages or other foods.

#### EP2: Are extraction products alcohol beverages?

TTB's initial testing of extraction products in the marketplace revealed that all of the products tested had 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume (ABV) which is the threshold alcohol content for products to be regulated as alcohol beverages, unless they are unfit for beverage purposes (See FAQ EP12). The extraction products tested ranged in alcohol content from 3.2 percent to 27.9 percent ABV. Testing by TTB revealed that many of the extraction products were fit for beverage purposes and subject to taxation and regulation, while some were found to be unfit for beverage purposes.

#### EP3: What are TTB's recent actions regarding extraction products in the marketplace?

We have analyzed samples of extraction products in the marketplace and tested the samples for alcohol content and fitness for beverage purposes. We will work with producers, distributors, or importers of extraction products so that they may comply with law and regulations and ensure that their products are appropriately labeled. Our primary concern is that consumers be adequately informed about the nature of alcohol beverage products being marketed as something else, such as dietary supplements.

#### EP4: Does the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act) apply to extraction products?

If you are a producer, importer, or wholesaler of extraction products that are alcohol beverages ( _i.e._ 0.5 percent or more ABV and fit for beverage purposes) you may be subject to the permit, labeling, and advertising requirements of the FAA Act, depending on the classification of the alcohol beverage product.\* The determination of whether an extraction product, that is an alcohol beverage, falls within the classification of a wine, malt beverage, or distilled spirits product under the FAA Act must be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on the formulation and method of production.

Some alcohol beverages are subject to tax as wine or beer but are not subject to the requirements of the FAA Act. For example, wine containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, and beer that is not made with both malted barley and hops, are exempt from the labeling requirements under the FAA Act and must comply with FDA labeling requirements, as well as the marking requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC), as amended.

\\* For more information on the FAA Act, see [27 U.S.C. 201(link is external)](http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/usc.cgi?ACTION=BROWSE&TITLE=27USCC8), et seq.

#### EP5: Are the containers of extraction products required to bear a health warning statement?

The container of any alcohol beverage product sold or distributed in the United States with an alcohol content of 0.5 percent ABV or more must bear the health warning statement required by the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 (ABLA).\* This requirement applies regardless of whether the product is subject to the labeling requirements of the FAA Act.

\\* For more information on ABLA and the TTB regulation, see [27 U.S.C. 215(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title27/html/USCODE-2011-title27-chap8-subchapII-sec215.htm) and [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=fd8b0ad16b93584273aefb7460a98eb4&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr16_main_02.tpl).

#### EP6: What rules apply to health claims on the labels or in advertisements for extraction products?

Due to the fact that extraction products are generally sold as dietary supplements or "natural health remedies," TTB has observed that the labels and advertising for the products often contain claims regarding the health effects derived from using the products.

If the products are determined to be alcohol beverages ( _i.e._ 0.5 percent ABV and fit for beverage purposes) any claims on labels or in advertising for the products would be subject to the labeling and advertising requirements of the FAA Act and the TTB regulations at [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4), [part 5(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-5) or [part 7(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&sid=d473aa9e89b3f7135e18c8da635f26aa&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr7_main_02.tpl). This includes the regulations regarding health-related statements.

Health-related statements are generally defined as statements related to health, including statements of a curative or therapeutic nature that, expressly or by implication, suggest a relationship between the consumption of alcohol beverages, or any substance found within alcohol beverages, and health benefits or effects on health. Health-related statements include both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits, or effects on health as well as health-related directional statements such as those terms which are defined in the regulations. Health-related statements also include statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the alcohol, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value ( _e.g.,_ statements of vitamin content).

In general, advertisements may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects of alcohol consumption on health. TTB will evaluate such statements on a case-by-case basis and may require as part of the health-related statement a disclaimer, or some other qualifying statement, to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related statement. Such disclaimer or other qualifying statement must appear as prominent as the health-related statement.

#### EP7: How will TTB classify extraction products that are considered alcohol beverages?

The tax classification of extraction products under the IRC will depend on the formulation and method of manufacture. The alcohol used in all of the extraction products tested by TTB was distilled spirits, and these FAQs address distilled spirits in greater detail than wine or beer. However, it is possible that extraction products could be manufactured with alcohol derived from fermentation, such as wine or beer. If distilled spirits are used in the formulation of the extraction product it will likely be classified as a distilled spirit. If wine is used in the formulation of the extraction product it will likely be classified as a wine and likewise if beer is used in the formulation of the extraction product it will likely be classified as a beer.

Manufacturers of extraction products may submit to the [Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division](https://www.ttb.gov/about-ttb/who-we-are/offices/alcohol-labeling-and-formulation-division "Alcohol Labeling and Formulation Division") a formula providing detailed information about the ingredients used in their product, and the method of manufacture. This is necessary in order for us to advise producers about the classification of their products, possible qualification requirements, and potential labeling requirements.

#### EP8: What requirements apply to my production of extraction products as alcohol beverages?

If you produce extraction products that contain 0.5 percent or more ABV and are found to be fit for beverage purposes, you are required to qualify as an alcohol beverage producer. Depending on the type of alcohol used in producing the extraction product you must [qualify as a distilled spirits plant](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1530), [qualify as a wine premises](https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/beverage-alcohol/wine/permits "Permits"), or [qualify as a brewer](https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/beverage-alcohol/beer/ttb-beer-brewers-notice "Brewer’s Notice") under [27 CFR part 19(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-19), [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24), or [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-25?toc=1) of the TTB regulations respectively. Extraction products that are determined to be alcohol beverages are also subject to excise taxes.

For example, if the extraction product is classified as distilled spirits, the regulations at [27 CFR 19.348(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-19.348) require the proprietor to file a formula on [TTB Form 5100.51](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510051.pdf "f510051.pdf") that includes a quantitative list of ingredients and a description of the method of manufacture or process of production used to produce the spirits. You must remove your distilled spirits from your premises in containers that comply with the requirements for containers and marks under [27 CFR part 19, subpart S(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-19#subpart-S). The product also will be subject to FAA Act requirements and the labeling and advertising requirements of [27 CFR part 5(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-5), including standard liquor bottles and standards of fill.

Similar requirements under [27 CFR part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-25?toc=1) will apply if the extraction product is classified as a beer and [27 CFR part 7(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7) will also apply if the extraction product is classified as a [malt beverage(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-7#p-7.1(Malt%20beverage)) as defined in the regulations. If the extraction product is classified as a wine, requirements under [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24) will apply and [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4?toc=1) will apply if the extraction product is classified as a wine and has 7 percent or more ABV. This includes requirements for standard wine containers and standards of fill.

Wines with 7 percent or more ABV and distilled spirits are also subject to the standards of fill requirements at 27 CFR [4.72(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4/subpart-H/section-4.72) and [5.203(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-5.203) respectively.

In addition, as previously noted, if your extraction product contains 0.5 percent or more ABV, your containers must bear the health warning statement, as outlined under [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-16).

#### EP10: What Federal tax applies if my extraction product is an alcohol beverage?

The IRC at [26 U.S.C. 5001(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title26/pdf/USCODE-2011-title26-subtitleE-chap51-subchapA-partI-subpartA-sec5001.pdf) imposes on all distilled spirits produced in or imported into the United States a tax at the rate of $13.50 on each proof gallon and a proportionate tax at the like rate on all fractional parts of a proof gallon.a proof gallon.

Information about taxes on wine can be found at [26 U.S.C. 5041(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2009-title26/pdf/USCODE-2009-title26-subtitleE-chap51-subchapA-partI-subpartC-sec5041.pdf), and information about taxes on beer can be found at [26 U.S.C. 5051(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title26/html/USCODE-2010-title26-subtitleE-chap51-subchapA-partI-subpartD-sec5051.htm).

#### EP11: What responsibilities do importers, wholesalers, and retailers have regarding extraction products that are determined to be alcohol beverages?

If the extraction product is a wine, malt beverage, or distilled spirits product subject to the FAA Act, importers and wholesalers of the product must [obtain a basic permit from TTB](https://www.ttb.gov/online-services/applications "Applying for a Permit and/or Registration"). Additionally, wholesalers and retailers of extraction products that are alcohol beverages must register with TTB as dealers in alcohol beverages, using form [TTB F 5630.5d](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f56305d.pdf "f56305d.pdf") or via [Permits Online](https://www.ttb.gov/online-services/ponl/customer-support "Permits Online Customer Page"). Dealers must meet the requirements outlined under the TTB regulations at [27 CFR part 31(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-31). Dealers also should contact [State and local alcohol regulatory authorities](https://www.ttb.gov/business-central/alcohol-beverage-authorities-in-united-states-canada-and-puerto-rico "Alcohol Beverage Authorities in United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico") to learn about State and local requirements.

#### EP12: How does TTB determine whether or not a product is unfit for beverage purposes?

TTB's [Nonbeverage Products Laboratory](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/form-5154-1-resources) has developed several tools and guidelines that limit subjectivity in determining if a product is unfit for beverage purposes.

To determine if an extraction product is unfit for beverage purposes, TTB may review the ingredients and formulation taking into account the presence of any flavor chemicals or other ingredients that would make the product unfit for beverage purposes.

Due to the extensive guidelines for nonbeverage product formulation, employing organoleptic tasting protocols to determine unfitness for beverage purposes is very rare. When used, it is for the purpose of determining whether the average person would mistake the product for an alcohol beverage.

- See our guidance on how you can be certain your product is [unfit for beverage purposes](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/dbmenu3).
- See our [tools](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/dbmenu3sub1 "What makes a product unfit?") to help you decide which set of guidelines is relevant to your product.

#### EP13: How can I ensure that my extraction product will not be considered an alcohol beverage?

One way to ensure that an extraction product will not be considered an alcohol beverage is to reduce the alcohol content of the product to less than 0.5 percent ABV in the final container used at retail either by diluting the product or eliminating the use of alcohol in the production process, either as an extraction agent or preservative.

If the alcohol content of the extraction product is 0.5 percent ABV or above and the extraction product is found to be fit for beverage purposes it must be reformulated to make it unfit for beverage purposes in order not to be considered an alcohol beverage. See FAQ EP12 for additional information on how products can be made unfit for beverage purposes.

If you have any questions about whether your product is unfit for beverage purposes, please [submit an inquiry](https://www.ttb.gov/about-ttb/contact-us/contact-ssd "Contact SSD") to TTB's [Nonbeverage Products Laboratory](https://www.ttb.gov/scientific-services-division/nonbeverage-products-laboratory-npl).

#### EP14: Can I file a claim for the tax paid on the alcohol used to produce my extraction products if they are unfit for beverage purposes?

Drawback is the portion of excise taxes returned to the manufacturer of nonbeverage products when the tax-paid on the distilled spirits is used to produce approved products unfit for beverage purposes. If you use distilled spirits on which tax was paid to produce your extraction products, you may be able to apply for a drawback of a portion of those taxes. To apply for tax drawback, you must submit a formula on [TTB Form 5154.1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f51541.pdf "f51541.pdf"). To file a drawback claim submit [TTB Form 5154.2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f51542.pdf "f51542.pdf") with the [National Revenue Center](https://www.ttb.gov/node/914).

See more information on [Claiming Drawback on Taxpaid Distilled Spirits Used in Manufacturing Nonbeverage Products](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/mnbp.pdf "mnbp.pdf").

Drawback of tax only applies to domestically produced products. No drawback of tax will be allowed on imported products, and no drawback is allowed for taxpaid wine or beer.

### Cider

#### CID1: What is "cider"?

When used generally in these FAQs, the terms "cider" and "hard cider" refer to wine fermented from apples (including apple juice or concentrate). However, the terms have different meanings under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC) and the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), as set forth further in these FAQs.

#### CID2: What products may be labeled as "cider" under the regulations implementing the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act?

The labeling regulations for wine set forth standards of identity for various classes of wine, including fruit wine. (See [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21).) Under these regulations, "apple wine" or "cider" is a fruit wine produced by the normal alcoholic fermentation of the juice of sound, ripe apples. Cider must be derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples.

The labeling of cider is subject to the regulations in 27 CFR part 4 only if the wine contains not less than 7 percent and not more than 24 percent alcohol by volume. Additional information about the standards of identity for cider and other fruit wines is contained in [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21).

#### CID3: Do I need to obtain a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) for my cider?

The FAA Act generally requires that a bottler obtain a [certificate of label approval](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") (COLA) from TTB prior to bottling wine. A bottler may obtain a [certificate of exemption](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") from label approval from TTB upon establishing that the wine will not be sold, shipped, or otherwise introduced in interstate or foreign commerce. Importers are required to obtain a COLA from TTB prior to removing wine in containers from customs custody for consumption.

The FAA Act and its implementing regulations do not apply to wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume; thus, cider with an alcohol content of less than 7 percent alcohol by volume is not subject to the COLA requirement. However, please note that all wine removed from wine premises is subject to TTB wine labeling requirements contained in [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257) (or [27 CFR 24.259(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.259) for containers larger than 4 liters). (See [CID 4](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c4) and [CID 5](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c5) for more information about the labeling of wines containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume.)

#### CID4: Do Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food labeling requirements apply to cider containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Yes. While a TTB COLA is _not_ required for wines containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, these wines must comply with applicable [FDA food labeling requirements(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006828.htm), including ingredient labeling, nutrient labeling, and allergen labeling requirements.

#### CID5: Is a health warning statement required on the container of an apple wine (cider) containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Yes. All alcohol beverages containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume must be labeled with the health warning statement required by [27 U.S.C. 215(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title27/pdf/USCODE-2013-title27-chap8-subchapII-sec215.pdf) and [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16).

#### CID6: Under the Federal Alcohol Administration (FAA) Act labeling regulations, is there a difference between "apple wine" and "cider"?

The labeling regulations allow either the term "apple wine" or "cider" as the designation for apple wine that complies with the standards of identity set forth in [27 CFR 4.21(e)(5)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21). You may also designate this product as "apple cider." Furthermore, the terms may be used interchangeably as part of a statement of composition for a wine specialty product (for example, "apple wine with natural blueberry flavor" or "cider with natural blueberry flavor").

#### CID7: What are the labeling requirements for cider that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

The label must meet the requirements of [27 CFR parts 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4) and [16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16). This includes, but is not limited to, the following mandatory information on the label:

- Brand name;
- Class or type designation;
- Name and address of the bottler or importer, as applicable;
- Net contents of the container;
- Alcohol content;
- Sulfite statement, if applicable (Contains Sulfites); and
- Health Warning Statement.

Other labeling statements may be required, in accordance with [27 CFR 4.32(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_132&rgn=div8). Furthermore, all wines must be labeled and marked in accordance with IRC requirements in [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&n=pt27.1.24&r=PART&ty=HTML) (for domestic wines), [27 CFR part 26(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-26?toc=1) (for wines coming into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) or [27 CFR part 27(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr27_main_02.tpl) (for imported wines).

#### CID8: May I label my wine made exclusively from pears as "pear cider"?

If the pear wine contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume and is made exclusively (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from pears, it may not be labeled as "pear cider." As noted in [CID2](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c2), wines designated as "cider" under [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21) must be derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from apples. The regulations provide that wine that is derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from pears must be designated as either "pear wine" or as "perry."

The labeling of perry is subject to the regulations in part 4 only if the wine contains not less than 7 percent and not more than 24 percent alcohol by volume. Additional information about the standards of identity for perry and other fruit wines are contained in [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21).

#### CID9: How do I designate a wine fermented from both apple juice and pear juice, where the wine has not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Under the regulations implementing the FAA Act, a wine produced from the fermentation of apple juice and pear juice must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition such as "apple-pear wine," "apple perry," or "pear cider." The designation "fruit wine" may appear in direct conjunction with the statement of composition. (See [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21) for more information.)

Please note that this type of wine does not require formula approval as long as it is produced in accordance with the rules for natural fruit wine under [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c397f2143c2d893be95e3a46accd6b43&node=pt27.1.24&rgn=div5).

#### CID10: How do I designate a wine fermented from both apple juice and blueberry juice, where the wine has not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Under the regulations implementing the FAA Act, a wine produced from the fermentation of apple juice and blueberry juice must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition such as "apple-blueberry wine" or "blueberry cider." The designation "fruit wine" may appear in direct conjunction with the statement of composition. (See [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21) for more information.)

Please note that this type of wine does not require formula approval as long as it is produced in accordance with the rules for natural fruit wine under [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c397f2143c2d893be95e3a46accd6b43&node=pt27.1.24&rgn=div5).

#### CID11: How do I designate a wine made from blending apple wine with pear wine, where the wine has not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Under the regulations implementing the FAA Act, a wine made from blending apple wine with pear wine must be designated with a statement of composition under [27 CFR 4.34(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_134&rgn=div8)(a), such as "apple wine - pear wine" or "cider - perry." The wine may also be labeled with a fanciful name (such as "apple pear delight"). The fanciful name "apple perry" or "pear cider" would not be approved because it is misleading as to the identity of the product.

Please note that this type of wine would require formula approval as an "other than standard" wine under [27 CFR 24.211(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1124e739baf10710c28294bd3f979e71&node=se27.1.24_1211&rgn=div8). (See [CID28](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c28) for information about obtaining formula approval.)

#### CID12: How do I designate a wine made from blending apple wine with blueberry wine, where the wine has not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Under the regulations implementing the FAA Act, a wine made from blending apple wine with blueberry wine must be designated with a statement of composition under [27 CFR 4.34(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_134&rgn=div8)(a), such as "apple wine - blueberry wine" or "cider and blueberry wine." The wine may also be labeled with a fanciful name (such as "apple blueberry delight"). The fanciful name "blueberry cider" would not be approved because it is misleading as to the identity of the product.

Please note that this type of wine would require formula approval as an "other than standard" wine under [27 CFR 24.211(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1124e739baf10710c28294bd3f979e71&node=se27.1.24_1211&rgn=div8). (See [CID28](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c28) for information about obtaining formula approval.)

#### CID13: May I add flavoring materials, such as honey, spices, natural flavors, or artificial flavors, to my cider?

If you add flavoring materials to apple wine, the resulting product may be a special natural wine or an "other than standard" wine under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), depending on how it is formulated. A proprietor of wine premises must obtain formula approval before producing either type of wine, even if the wine has less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. (See [CID28](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c28) for information about formulas and [CID14](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c14) for information on the labeling of flavored wines.)

#### CID14: How do I designate a wine made from apple wine that has been flavored with honey, spices, natural flavors or artificial flavors?

Under the labeling regulations that implement the FAA Act, this type of wine may not be designated as simply "cider" because it no longer meets the standards of identity set forth in [27 CFR 4.21(e)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21). Instead, it must be labeled with a statement of composition in accordance with [27 CFR 4.22(a)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.22) and [27 CFR 4.34(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=1124e739baf10710c28294bd3f979e71&node=se27.1.4_134&rgn=div8). As part of the formula approval, TTB will provide a suggested statement of composition for the product designation, such as "cider with artificial and natural blueberry flavors" or "apple cider with honey and spices." If you wish, you may also label the wine with a fanciful name but this name may not be misleading as to the identity of the product. Accordingly, the fanciful name "blueberry cider" would not be approved for an apple wine with natural blueberry flavor.

If your flavored wines contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, the labeling regulations in 27 CFR part 4 do not apply; instead, [FDA food labeling rules(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006828.htm) apply.

#### CID15: May I label my cider as "hard cider" even if it doesn't qualify for the hard cider tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6)?

Yes. If your wine has not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, and it complies with the standards of identity for "cider" under [27 CFR 4.21(e)(5)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21), it may be labeled as either "cider" or "hard cider." Pursuant to [27 CFR 4.32(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=1124e739baf10710c28294bd3f979e71&r=SECTION&n=se27.1.4_132) and [4.36(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=1124e739baf10710c28294bd3f979e71&r=SECTION&n=se27.1.4_136), the wine must also be labeled with a numerical statement of alcohol content (unless it has no more than 14 percent alcohol by volume and it is designated as a "fruit table wine" or an "apple table wine") - this labeling information will adequately convey that the product is not eligible for the "hard cider" tax rate.

If your wine is not subject to the FAA Act labeling requirements, it must still be labeled in accordance with the regulations at [27 CFR 24.257(a)(4)(iv)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257) before removal from wine premises. These regulations require the wine to be labeled with the class or type of wine or with a statement of composition that, when viewed with the alcohol content, gives enough information to adequately identify the tax class of the wine. For example, a still wine that is labeled "hard cider with natural raspberry flavor" and "6 percent alcohol by volume" is adequately marked to identify the wine's tax class, because the raspberry flavor makes it ineligible for the hard cider tax rate.

#### CID16: Do special labeling requirements apply to effervescent cider?

Yes. An effervescent wine is a wine that contains more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters. See [27 CFR 24.10(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=15ecb5b77b8d6f1f61b54155027a5353&node=se27.1.24_110&rgn=div8). Under [27 CFR 4.21(e)(5)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21) and [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257), effervescent cider must be labeled as "sparkling" or "carbonated," as appropriate. (See [CID17](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c17) for more information.)

#### CID17: What is the difference between "sparkling" cider and "carbonated" cider?

A "sparkling wine" is made effervescent (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine) by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. A sparkling cider must be labeled either as "sparkling cider" or "sparkling apple wine." A wine made effervescent in any other way (such as injection of carbon dioxide) is considered artificially carbonated, and must be labeled as "carbonated" (for example, "carbonated cider" or "carbonated apple wine").

#### CID18: Are effervescent wines subject to different tax rates from still wines?

Under the IRC, sparkling and artificially carbonated wines are subject to higher rates of tax than still wine. (See [CID21](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c21) for more information about the tax rates.)

Furthermore, sparkling and carbonated ciders are not eligible for the hard cider tax rate provided by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6) or for the exemption from tax provided by 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1). (See [CID23](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c23) and [CID25](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c25) for more information.)

#### CID19: May I label my cider with an appellation of origin?

TTB regulations at [27 CFR 4.25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.25) permit fruit wine (including cider) to be labeled with an appellation of origin such as a country, State or county, assuming that certain conditions are met. However, only grape wine may be labeled with an appellation that is a viticultural area.

#### CID20: Do TTB's standards of fill apply to cider? May I sell my cider in 12 fl. oz. bottles or in kegs?

Yes, TTB's standards of fill apply to cider and all other wine products that contain 7 percent or more alcohol by volume.  Producers, importers, and wholesalers are prohibited from selling or shipping, or delivering for sale or shipment, or otherwise introducing in interstate commerce, wine that is not bottled or packed in container sizes that are authorized as a standard of fill. (See [27 CFR 4.70(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.70).)

An authorized standard of fill for wine is 355 milliliters (mL), which is the equivalent metric volume of twelve fluid ounces (12 fl. oz.). (See [27 CFR 4.72(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.72).)  If you sell wine that contains 7 percent or more alcohol by volume in twelve fluid ounce containers, the label must state the net contents as “355 mL.” The statement “355 mL (12 fl. oz.)” also would be acceptable.  (See [27 CFR 4.37(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#4.37).)

In addition, wine may be packed in kegs as long as the keg conforms to one of the standards of fill. However, wine packed in containers of 18 liters or more does not need to comply with standards of fill requirements. (See [27 CFR 4.70(b)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.70).)

If wine contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, the standards of fill in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4) do not apply.

**Updated as of August 2, 2022**:  This FAQ was updated to reflect regulatory amendments issued under [T.D. TTB-165(link is external)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/29/2020-28747/addition-of-new-standards-of-fill-for-wine-and-distilled-spirits-amendment-of-distilled-spirits-and).

#### CID21: What are the Federal excise tax rates for cider?

Ciders that are not subject to the special rules set forth in [CID23](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c23) or [CID25](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c25) are taxed at the appropriate [wine excise tax](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1943) rate. The following are the basic tax classification categories for wine:

Still wine (containing not more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters):

- Not more than 16 percent alcohol by volume: $1.07 per wine gallon
- Over 16 and not more than 21 percent alcohol by volume: $1.57 per wine gallon
- Over 21 and not more than 24 percent alcohol by volume: $3.15 per wine gallon

Effervescent wine (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters):

- Artificially Carbonated Wine: $3.30 per wine gallon
- Sparkling Wine: $3.40 per wine gallon

Last reviewed/updated 02/03/2015

#### CID22: For tax purposes, what is the difference between "sparkling" cider and "artificially carbonated" cider?

A "sparkling wine" is made effervescent (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine) by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. A wine made effervescent in any other way (such as injection of carbon dioxide) is considered artificially carbonated. (See [CID16](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c16) and [CID17](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c17) for information about the labeling of these products.)

Please note that both sparkling ciders and carbonated ciders are _not_ _eligible_ for the hard cider tax rate provided by 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6) or for the exemption from tax provided by 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1). (See [CID23](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c23) and [CID25](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c25) for more information.)

#### CID23: What are the tax rates for "hard cider" under 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6)?

The IRC provides a tax rate of 22.6¢ per wine gallon for "hard cider" that meets specific statutory criteria. To qualify for this tax rate, hard cider must be a still wine derived primarily from apples or apple concentrate and water, containing no other fruit product, and containing at least 0.5 percent and less than 8.5 percent alcohol by volume.  (See 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6))

The regulations at [27 CFR 24.10(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=15ecb5b77b8d6f1f61b54155027a5353&node=se27.1.24_110&rgn=div8) set forth a definition of "hard cider" that is eligible for the hard cider tax rate of 22.6¢ per gallon. Under the law and regulations, cider must meet _all_ of the following criteria in order to qualify for the "hard cider" tax rate:

- The cider must be a still wine. This means it must contain no more than 0.64 gram of carbon dioxide per hundred milliliters of wine. Effervescent cider (including sparkling and carbonated cider) is _not_ eligible for the hard cider tax rate;
- The wine must be derived primarily from apples or apple concentrate and water. This means that apple juice, or the equivalent amount of concentrate reconstituted to the original brix of the juice prior to concentration, must represent more than 50 percent of the volume of the finished product;
- The wine must contain no other fruit product (such as juice from a fruit other than apples); nor may it contain any artificial product that imparts a fruit flavor other than apple (such as an artificial pear or blueberry flavor);
- The wine must contain at least 0.5 percent but less than 8.5 percent alcohol by volume. Any wine containing 8.5 percent or more alcohol by volume is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate;
- The wine must have the taste, aroma, and characteristics generally attributed to hard cider; and
- The wine must be sold or offered for sale as hard cider.

(See [CID15](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c15) for information about using the designation "hard cider" on labels.)

#### CID24: I add artificial raspberry flavor to my cider, which has an alcohol content of 6 percent alcohol by volume. Does the addition of this flavor affect the cider's eligibility for the hard cider tax rate?

Yes. Because the IRC provides that the hard cider tax rate under 26 U.S.C. 5041(b)(6) is not available to wines that contain a fruit product other than apple, a cider containing either natural or artificial fruit flavors (other than apple flavors) is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate of 22.6¢ per gallon. (See [CID23](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c23).) Instead, a fruit-flavored cider would be taxed at the appropriate wine excise tax rate. (See [CID21](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c21).)

Please note that non-fruit flavors such as spices or honey would not affect a cider's eligibility for the hard cider tax rate. You will need formula approval for this product because flavors have been added. (See [CID28](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c28).)

#### CID25: What type of cider is exempt from Federal excise taxes on wine under 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1)?

The IRC provides a tax exemption for certain ciders as outlined in 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1) and [27 CFR 24.76(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.76). This is an extremely limited exemption that was intended to allow an exemption from the wine tax for farmers and growers who produced fermented cider for sale at roadside stands.

To qualify for this exemption, cider must meet _all_ of the following criteria:

- The cider must be produced solely from the noneffervescent fermentation of apple juice. Sugars, syrups or concentrate may not be added to tax exempt cider. Any cider that is effervescent (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 ml) is _not_ eligible for the exemption from tax;
- The cider must be made without the use of any preservative methods or materials (such as the use of pasteurization or the addition of sulfites);
- The cider must be produced at a place other than a bonded wine premises; and

The cider must be sold or offered for sale as cider and not as wine or a substitute for wine.

#### CID26: We removed this FAQ because it was out-of-date.

No results.

#### CID27: We removed this FAQ because it was out-of-date.

No results.

#### CID28: Do I need to obtain TTB formula approval before producing cider or other fruit wine?

No formula approval is required to produce natural cider or other natural fruit wine, even if the wine is fermented from the juice of different fruits. A "natural" wine is the product of the juice or must of sound, ripe fruit (including berries) made with any cellar treatment authorized by Subparts F and L of part 24 and containing not more than 21 percent by weight (21 degrees Brix dealcoholized wine) of total solids. (See [27 CFR 24.10(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=15ecb5b77b8d6f1f61b54155027a5353&node=se27.1.24_110&rgn=div8).) However, TTB formula approval is required for:

- Wine produced by blending two finished fruit wines together (for example, apple wine and pear wine);
- Wine with added flavors or spices; and
- Wine made with excess sugar and/or water or other cellar treatments not authorized for natural wine in Subparts F and L of part 24.

Additional information about obtaining TTB formula approval may be found on TTB's [formulation Web page](https://www.ttb.gov/node/559).

#### CID29: What IRC labeling requirements apply to all cider and other wine removed from wine premises?

Although TTB's FAA Act wine labeling regulations in part 4 do not apply to wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, IRC labeling requirements and TTB regulations at [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257) apply to all wines that are removed from wine premises. Under these regulations, labels must include the following information:

- Name and address of the wine premises;
- Brand name;
- Alcohol content;
- Net contents of the container; and
- Kind of wine, which means -
  - Class or type in accordance with 27 CFR Part 4; or
  - An adequate statement of composition for wines not subject to part 4. Statements of composition must include enough information to identify the tax class when viewed with the alcohol content.

Containers larger than 4 liters removed from the winery for consumption or sale must be labeled with this information as required by [27 CFR 24.259(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.259). The required information may be cut, printed, or otherwise legibly and durably marked upon the container or placed on a label or tag securely affixed to the container.

#### CID30: Do I need to obtain a permit from TTB to produce apple wine (cider) for commercial purposes?

Yes. If you are producing wine (including cider) that is at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume for commercial purposes, you must first establish winery premises, obtain a bond, and receive permission from TTB to operate. (See [27 CFR part 24, subpart D(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-D).)  In addition, the FAA Act requires that anyone wishing to engage in the business of producing or blending wine (including cider) that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume must first obtain a basic permit from TTB. (See [27 CFR part 1(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1?toc=1).) A basic permit under the FAA Act is not required for producers who only make wine that is less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. For more information on qualification requirements, [The Federal Application Process for the Wine Industry.](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1278)

If you produce only tax-exempt cider that satisfies all of the requirements of 26 U.S.C. 5042(a)(1), and 27 CFR 24.76 you are not required to qualify as a bonded wine premises. (See [CID25](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c25) for more information about these requirements.)

#### CID31: I import wine (including cider). What TTB requirements apply to my operations?

If you import wine (including cider) that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, you must:

- Obtain an [Importer's Basic Permit](https://www.ttb.gov/node/347) under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act;
- Obtain a [certificate of label approval](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") for your cider;
- Label the wine in accordance with [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4);
- Label the wine with the health warning statement required by [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16);
- Submit a pre-import letter (or formula) if required by Industry Circular 2007-4;
- Pay the appropriate wine excise tax rate for the wine (see [CID 21](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c21)); and
- If required, obtain certification from the country of origin regarding the cellar treatment of the wine. (For more information, see our Web page on [certification requirements for imported natural wine](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1269).)

If you also import wine (including cider) that contains at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume and less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, the following requirements apply:

- Label the wine in accordance with all applicable [FDA food labeling requirements(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006828.htm);
- Label the wine with the health warning statement required by [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16);
- Pay the appropriate wine excise tax rate for the wine (see [CID 21](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#c21));
- Label the wine in accordance with [27 CFR part 27(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-27); and
- If required, obtain certification from the country of origin regarding the cellar treatment of the wine. (For more information, see our Web page on [certification requirements for imported natural wine](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1269).)

You do _not_ need to obtain an Importer's Basic Permit if you import _only_ wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. Additional information regarding the importation of alcohol beverages into the U.S. may be found on the [International Affairs Division Web page](https://www.ttb.gov/node/762).

#### CID32: How should I report kegs of cider and/or perry on my Report of Wine Premises Operations form (TTB F 5120.17)?

Report kegs of cider and/or perry on your [Report of Wine Premises Operations](https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/beverage-alcohol/wine/report-of-wine-premises-operations "Report of Wine Premises Operations Form 5120.17 Reminder") form ( [TTB F 5120.17](https://www.ttb.gov/regulated-commodities/beverage-alcohol/wine/report-of-wine-premises-operations "Report of Wine Premises Operations Form 5120.17 Reminder")) based on the container size. (Containers include bottles, cans, boxes, and kegs.) See wine FAQ [W29](https://www.ttb.gov/wine/wine-faqs) for further guidance.

### Honey Wine (Mead)

#### HW1: What is "honey wine" under the IRC?

Honey wine is classified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (IRC), as an "agricultural wine." Agricultural wine is made from the fermentation of an agricultural product other than the juice of fruit. (See [27 CFR 24.200(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-I/section-24.200) and [24.203(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.24_1203&rgn=div8).) The production standards under [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&n=pt27.1.24&r=PART&ty=HTML) for honey wine apply only to domestic products.

The IRC does not allow for the use of coloring or flavoring materials (other than hops) in standard honey wine. (See [26 U.S.C. 5387(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title26/pdf/USCODE-2013-title26-subtitleE-chap51-subchapF-partIII-sec5387.pdf) and [HW14](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw14) for more information.) Furthermore, wine spirits may not be added to standard honey wine, and standard honey wine may not contain more than 14 percent alcohol by volume. The IRC does provide for the production of wine specialty products that are made from a base of honey wine. These products are not standard agricultural wines, but are instead classified under the IRC regulations as "other than standard" (OTS) wines. (See [27 CFR 24.218.(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-J/section-24.218))

#### HW2: What is "honey wine" under the FAA Act labeling regulations?

Under the regulations implementing the labeling provisions of the Federal Alcohol Administration Act (FAA Act), the standards of identity for wine made from the fermentation of agricultural products other than fruit are set forth in [27 CFR 4.21(f)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8). Pursuant to these regulations, a product designated as "honey wine" must be derived wholly (except for sugar, water, or added alcohol) from honey. Wines designated as "honey wine" under [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4) also may contain hops, consistent with the levels set forth in [part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&n=pt27.1.24&r=PART&ty=HTML). TTB allows the designation "mead" to be used in lieu of "honey wine." (See [HW6](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw6).)

Certain wines fermented from honey that do not meet the standards of identity under [§ 4.21(f)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8) fall under the standards set forth in [27 CFR 4.21(h)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8), and thus must be designated as "imitation" or "other than standard" (OTS) wines. Other specialty products do not fall under any of the standards of identity in [part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4) and must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition. (See [27 CFR 4.34(a)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_134&rgn=div8).)

#### HW3: Do I need to obtain a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA) for my mead?

The FAA Act generally requires that a bottler obtain a [certificate of label approval](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") (COLA) from TTB prior to bottling wine. A bottler may obtain a [certificate of exemption](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf") from label approval from TTB upon establishing that the wine will not be sold, shipped, or otherwise introduced in interstate or foreign commerce. Importers are required to obtain a COLA from TTB prior to removing wine in containers from customs custody for consumption.

The FAA Act and its implementing regulations do not apply to wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume; thus mead with an alcohol content of less than 7 percent alcohol by volume is not subject to the COLA requirement. However, please note that all wine removed from wine premises is subject to TTB wine labeling requirements contained in [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257) (or [27 CFR 24.259(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.259) for containers larger than 4 liters). (See [HW4](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw4) and [HW5](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw5) for more information about the labeling of these wines.)

#### HW4: Do Food and Drug Administration (FDA) food labeling requirements apply to honey wine containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Yes. While a TTB COLA is _not_ required for wines containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, such wines must comply with applicable [FDA food labeling requirements(link is external)](https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm2006828.htm), including ingredient labeling, nutrient labeling, and allergen labeling requirements.

#### HW5: Is a health warning statement required on the container of a honey wine containing less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

Yes. All alcohol beverages containing 0.5 percent or more alcohol by volume must be labeled with the health warning statement required by [27 U.S.C. 215(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title27/pdf/USCODE-2013-title27-chap8-subchapII-sec215.pdf) and [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16).

#### HW6: Under the FAA Act labeling regulations, is there a difference between "honey wine" and "mead"?

For labeling purposes, it is TTB's policy to allow either the term "honey wine" or "mead" as the designation for honey wine that complies with the standards of identity for honey wine set forth in [27 CFR 4.21(f)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8). Furthermore, the terms may be used interchangeably as part of a statement of composition for a wine specialty product (for example, "honey wine with natural cherry flavor" or "mead with natural cherry flavor").

#### HW7: What are the labeling requirements for honey wine that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume?

The label must meet the requirements of [27 CFR parts 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4) and [16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16). This includes, but is not limited to, the following mandatory information on the label:

- Brand name;
- Class or type designation;
- Name and address of the bottler or importer, as applicable;
- Net contents of the container;
- Alcohol content;
- Sulfite statement, if applicable (Contains Sulfites); and
- Health Warning Statement.

Other labeling statements may be required, in accordance with [27 CFR 4.32(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_132&rgn=div8). Furthermore, all wines containing at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume must be labeled and marked in accordance with IRC requirements in [27 CFR part 24(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&n=pt27.1.24&r=PART&ty=HTML) (for domestic wines), [27 CFR part 26(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-26?toc=1) (for wines coming into the United States from Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands) or [27 CFR part 27(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr27_main_02.tpl) (for imported wines).

#### HW8: How do I label a standard agricultural wine that is fermented from both honey and another agricultural product?

A wine fermented from more than one agricultural product (for example, a wine that is fermented from both honey and rhubarb) may not be designated as "honey wine" or "mead" under TTB regulations. Instead, the wine must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition, such as "rhubarb-honey wine" or "rhubarb mead." (See [27 CFR 4.21(f)(6)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.21).)

#### HW9: How do I label a wine that is fermented from both honey and a fruit juice?

A wine fermented from both fruit juice and an agricultural product does not fall within any of the standards of identity in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4). This type of wine must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition in accordance with [27 CFR 4.34(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_134&rgn=div8), such as "cherry-honey wine" or "cherry mead." The wine also may be labeled with a distinctive or fanciful name, such as "Cherry bee."

#### HW10: What is the appropriate designation for a product consisting of honey wine blended with fruit wine (such as blueberry wine)?

This product does not fall under any of the standards of identity in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4), and thus must be labeled with a truthful and adequate statement of composition, such as "blueberry wine – honey wine," "blueberry wine and honey wine" or "blueberry wine – mead." In this instance, TTB would not approve a label with the term "blueberry mead" as either a fanciful name or as a designation because it would be misleading as to the identity of the wine.

#### HW11: Do special labeling requirements apply to effervescent honey wine?

Yes. An effervescent wine is a wine that contains more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters. (See [27 CFR 24.10(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.24_110&rgn=div8).) Under [27 CFR 4.21(f)(6)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8) and [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-L/subject-group-ECFRedd68e72f7e8197/section-24.257), effervescent honey wine must be labeled as "sparkling" or "carbonated," as appropriate. (See [HW12](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw12) for more information.)

#### HW12: What is the difference between "sparkling" honey wine and "carbonated" honey wine?

A "sparkling wine" is made effervescent (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine) by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. A sparkling honey wine must be labeled either as "sparkling mead" or "sparkling honey wine." A wine made effervescent in any other way (such as injection of carbon dioxide) is considered artificially carbonated, and must be labeled as "carbonated" (for example, "carbonated mead" or "carbonated honey wine").

#### HW13: Are effervescent wines subject to different tax rates from still wines?

Under the IRC, sparkling and artificially carbonated wines are subject to higher rates of tax than still wine. (See [HW22](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw22) and [HW23](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw23) for more information about the tax rates).

#### HW14: May I add coloring or flavoring materials to my honey wine?

If you add coloring or flavoring materials (other than hops) to honey wine, the product is no longer a standard agricultural wine under the IRC. (See [26 U.S.C. 5387(b)(link is external)](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2013-title26/pdf/USCODE-2013-title26-subtitleE-chap51-subchapA-partI-subpartC-sec5041.pdf) and [27 CFR 24.200(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.200).) Furthermore, the product is no longer a "honey wine" under the FAA Act labeling regulations. However, you may produce a wine specialty product by adding flavoring and coloring materials to a base of honey wine. Because the product does not fall under any of the standards of identity set out in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr4_main_02.tpl), it must be designated with a truthful and adequate statement of composition, such as "honey wine with natural ginger flavor" or "mead with natural cherry flavor." The wine also may be labeled with a distinctive or fanciful name (such as "cherry honey delight"). In this case, TTB would not approve a label with a term such as "cherry mead" as either a fanciful name or a designation because it would be misleading as to the identity of the wine. However, a name such as "cherry-flavored mead" would be acceptable as the fanciful name, as long as an appropriate statement of composition appears as the designation.

#### HW15: May I label my honey wine with an appellation of origin?

TTB regulations at [27 CFR 4.25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.25) permit wine (including an agricultural wine that falls under the standards of identity in [27 CFR 4.21(f)(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&node=se27.1.4_121&rgn=div8)) to be labeled with an appellation of origin such as a country, State or county, assuming that certain conditions are met. However, only grape wine may be labeled with an appellation that is a viticultural area.

#### HW16: Do TTB's standards of fill apply to mead? May I sell my mead in 12 fl. oz. bottles or in kegs?

Yes, TTB's standards of fill apply to mead and all other wine products that contain 7 percent or more alcohol by volume.  Producers, importers, and wholesalers are prohibited from selling or shipping, or delivering for sale or shipment, or otherwise introducing in interstate commerce, wine that is not bottled or packed in container sizes that are authorized as a standard of fill. (See [27 CFR 4.70(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.70).)

An authorized standard of fill for wine is 355 milliliters (mL), which is the equivalent metric volume of twelve fluid ounces (12 fl. oz.). (See 27 CFR 4.72.)  If you sell wine that contains 7 percent or more alcohol by volume in twelve fluid ounce containers, the label must state the net contents as “355 mL.”  The statement “355 mL (12 fl. oz.)” also would be acceptable.  (See [27 CFR 4.37(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-4#4.37).)

In addition, wine may be packed in kegs as long as the keg conforms to one of the standards of fill. However, wine packed in containers of 18 liters or more does not need to comply with standards of fill requirements. (See [27 CFR 4.70(b)(2)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-4.70).)

If wine contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, the standards of fill in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4) do not apply.

**Updated as of August 2, 2022**:  This FAQ was updated to reflect regulatory amendments issued under [T.D. TTB-165(link is external)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/29/2020-28747/addition-of-new-standards-of-fill-for-wine-and-distilled-spirits-amendment-of-distilled-spirits-and).

#### HW17: What are the production standards under 27 CFR part 24 for standard honey wine produced in the United States?

TTB regulations at [27 CFR 24.203(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.203) state that the following may be added in the production of standard honey wine:

- Water to facilitate fermentation, provided the density of the honey and water mixture is not reduced below 13 degrees Brix;
- Hops in quantities not to exceed one pound for each 1,000 pounds of honey; and
- Pure, dry sugar or honey for sweetening. Sugar may be added only after fermentation is completed.

After complete fermentation or complete fermentation and sweetening, the wine may not have an alcohol content of more than 14 percent by volume or a total solids content that exceeds 35 degrees Brix.

#### HW18: Do I need to obtain TTB formula approval before producing standard honey wine?

All domestically produced agricultural wines, including honey wine, are subject to the formula requirements in [27 CFR 24.201](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1261). However, in [TTB Ruling 2016-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2016-2.pdf "2016-2.pdf") TTB approved general-use formulas for certain standard agricultural wines made from honey, dried fruit, or certain other agricultural products listed in the ruling and produced in accordance with the standards set forth in [27 CFR 24, subpart I](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1261). As a result, a person producing honey wine in accordance with 27 CFR §§ 24.200 and 24.203 is granted approval of a general-use formula and does not need to submit a formula to TTB. As provided in § 24.200, standard agricultural honey wine may not be colored or flavored (except that hops may be used as outlined in § 24.203), may not contain added spirits, and may not consist of wine made from one agricultural product that is blended with wine made from another agricultural product. Section 24.203 contains limitations on the use of sugar and water in the production of standard honey wine. Producers of honey wines that are not made in accordance with these regulatory standards must still submit a formula to TTB. Please see [TTB Ruling 2016-2](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/2016-2.pdf "2016-2.pdf") for additional information.

#### HW19: Does the IRC allow me to produce honey wine that is not a standard agricultural wine?

If you wish to add coloring or flavoring materials (other than hops) to a honey wine base, or if you wish to blend honey wine with other wine, you must first obtain approval of a formula for an "other than standard" (OTS) wine under the IRC. (See [27 CFR 24.218(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=9912bb866bbb6880ef1377ecb2a31830&node=se27.1.24_1218&rgn=div8).) (Also see [HW10](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw10) and [HW14](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw14) for information about the labeling of such products.)

#### HW20: What IRC labeling requirements apply to all honey wine removed from bonded wine premises?

Although TTB's FAA Act wine labeling regulations in [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr4_main_02.tpl) do not apply to wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, IRC labeling requirements and TTB regulations at [27 CFR 24.257(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.257) apply to all wines removed from wine premises. Under TTB regulations, labels must include the following information:

- Name and address of the wine premises;
- Brand name;
- Alcohol content;
- Net contents of the container; and
- Kind of wine, which means –
  - Class or type in accordance with [part 4(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr4_main_02.tpl); or
  - An adequate statement of composition for wines not subject to [part 4(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr4_main_02.tpl). Statements of composition must include enough information to identify the tax class when viewed with the alcohol content.

Containers larger than 4 liters removed from the winery for consumption or sale must be labeled with this information as required by [27 CFR 24.259(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.259). The required information may be cut, printed, or otherwise legibly and durably marked upon the container or placed on a label or tag securely affixed to the container.

#### HW21: Do I need to obtain a permit from TTB to produce honey wine (mead) for commercial purposes?

Yes. If you are producing wine (including mead) that is at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume for commercial purposes, you must first establish winery premises, obtain a bond, and receive permission from TTB to operate. (See [27 CFR part 24, subpart D(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-D).) In addition, the FAA Act requires that anyone wishing to engage in the business of producing or blending wine (including mead) that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume must first obtain a basic permit from TTB. (See [27 CFR part 1(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-1?toc=1).) A basic permit under the FAA Act is not required for producers who only make wine that is less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. For more information on qualification requirements, see [https://www.ttb.gov/wine/federal-application-process](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1278).

#### HW22: What are the Federal excise tax rates for wine?

For more information, see [Tax and Fee Rates](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1319#wine).

#### HW23: For tax purposes, what is the difference between "sparkling" wine and "artificially carbonated" wine?

A "sparkling wine" is made effervescent (containing more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters of wine) by carbon dioxide resulting solely from the secondary fermentation of the wine within a closed container, tank or bottle. A wine made effervescent in any other way (such as injection of carbon dioxide) is considered artificially carbonated. (See [HW11](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw11) and [HW12](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw12) for information about the labeling of these products.)

#### HW24: We removed this FAQ because it was out-of-date.

No results.

#### HW25: I import honey wine. What TTB requirements apply to my operations?

If you import honey wine (mead) that contains not less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, you must:

- [Obtain an Importer's Basic Permit](https://www.ttb.gov/node/347) under the Federal Alcohol Administration Act;
- Submit a pre-import letter (or formula) in accordance with Industry Circular 2007-4;
- Obtain a [certificate of label approval](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/forms/f510031.pdf "f510031.pdf");
- Label the wine in accordance with [27 CFR part 4(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-4);
- Label the wine with the health warning statement required by [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16);
- Pay the appropriate wine excise tax rate for the wine ( [see HW22](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw22)).

If you also import wine (including mead) that is at least 0.5 percent alcohol by volume and less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, the following requirements apply:

- Label the wine in accordance with all applicable FDA food labeling requirements;
- Label the wine with the Health Warning Statement required by [27 CFR part 16(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/part-16);
- Pay the appropriate excise tax rate ( [see HW 22](https://www.ttb.gov/faqs/alcohol#hw22));
- Label the wine in accordance with [27 CFR part 27(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c6cc5abf6cca179c73093e2e7d18db11&tpl=/ecfrbrowse/Title27/27cfr27_main_02.tpl).

You do _not_ need to obtain an Importer's Basic Permit if you import _only_ wine that contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume. Additional information regarding the importation of alcohol beverages into the U.S. may be found on the [International Affairs Division webpage](https://www.ttb.gov/node/762).

#### HW26: May a brewer produce honey wine (mead) on brewery premises?

No. TTB regulations at [27 CFR 25.23(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-25.23) do not permit the production of wine (including mead) on brewery premises. However, brewers may apply to TTB for permission to alternate the use of a portion of the brewery with a winery premises as outlined in [27 CFR 25.81(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-25.81).

#### HW27: I would like to blend honey wine (mead) and beer. Is that permitted under TTB regulations?

No. Under Federal law and TTB regulations, the blending of wine (including mead) and beer is not an authorized operation at a winery (see [27 CFR 24.101(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-24.101)) or a brewery (see [27 CFR 25.23(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/section-25.23)). Under TTB regulations, beer must be brewed from malt or from a substitute for malt. However, a brewer may use honey as an adjunct in the fermentation of beer on brewery premises, subject to the regulations in [part 25(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-25?toc=1). (See [27 CFR 25.15(a)(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-25/subpart-B/subject-group-ECFR6ebce257c6ef31d/section-25.15).)

#### HW28: May I label a malt beverage fermented from honey and malted barley as "mead"?

No. Because "mead" is viewed as a synonym for "honey wine," it is TTB's position that the term may not be used as a designation for a malt beverage. The term "braggot" may be used as additional information on the label of such a product, but it would not suffice as the designation by itself. (See [TTB Ruling 2015-1](https://www.ttb.gov/system/files/images/pdfs/rulings/ttb-ruling-2015-1-malt-beverage-formulas.pdf "ttb-ruling-2015-1-malt-beverage-formulas.pdf") for more information about the appropriate designation of malt beverages made with honey.)

### Shelf Schematics

#### SSQ1: Why was TTB Ruling 2016-1 issued?

TTB issued Ruling 2016-1 in response to complaints from a number of industry members who expressed concerns over potential abuse of the narrow Tied-House exception provided for in 27 CFR 6.99(b), which removes only the act of providing a recommended shelf plan or shelf schematic from the prohibited means to induce enumerated in 27 U.S.C. 205(b)(3).  As a result of these complaints, TTB conducted a limited market review pertaining to traditional “category management” activities and the concerns that were brought to its attention.  As a result of its market review, TTB found that there is a misunderstanding about what activities are permitted under the § 6.99(b) exception.  Accordingly, TTB issued TTB Ruling 2016-1 to clarify what is and is not exempted under such exception.

#### SSQ2: Why didn’t TTB issue a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking?

It was not necessary.  TTB Ruling 2016-1 merely provides guidance as to the plain meaning of the existing regulation under 27 CFR 6.99(b).  It does not change TTB’s longstanding position, nor does it change the meaning of the plain language of this regulatory exception.

#### SSQ3: Does TTB Ruling 2016-1 prohibit industry members from acting as “category captains” or from engaging in “category management” activities?

The terms “category management” and “category captain” are not defined in the TTB regulations and can mean different things to different industry members.  TTB Ruling 2016-1 reminds the industry what is exempted by 27 CFR 6.99(b); specifically, providing a recommended shelf plan or shelf schematic, and nothing further.  TTB considers additional services or things of value not specifically exempted by a subpart D exception, whether or not referenced as “category management services,” as inducements under 27 CFR 6.41 of the TTB regulations.  Many of the common services given under the term “category management/category captain” may be considered things of value and, as such, inducements under the Tied-House statute and regulations.  If such practice results in exclusion of competitor products, in whole or in part, such that the retailer’s independence is at risk, with the requisite connection to interstate or foreign commerce, and if (in the case of malt beverages only) there is a similar State law, the practice would violate the FAA Act.

#### SSQ4: Are there certain services or things of value that are not considered inducements under the Tied-House regulations?

Subject to specific recordkeeping requirements, the subpart D exceptions found in 27 CFR part 6 that allow industry members to provide a recommended shelf plan also generally authorize providing certain other things of value, such as:

- Product displays not to exceed $300 per brand.
- Point of sale/consumer advertising items such as posters, coasters, paper napkins, foam scrapers, calendars, ash trays, cork screws, shirts and caps.
- Consumer coupons and direct contests.
- Consumer tastings and samplings.

Providing a service or thing of value to a retailer that is not specifically exempted under the 27 CFR part 6 subpart D exceptions, constitutes an inducement under the Tied-House provisions.

#### SSQ5: What does TTB mean when it says in Ruling 2016-1 "This Ruling illustrates what a shelf plan or shelf schematic is, and is not, relative to the exception in 27 CFR 6.99(b). A shelf plan or shelf schematic provided under this exception is a simple sales tool offering options as to how an industry member thinks a retailer’s shelves should appear.”

The TTB regulations at 27 CFR 6.99(b) state that the act by an industry member of providing a “recommended” shelf plan or shelf schematic for distilled spirits, wine, or malt beverages does not constitute a means to induce within the meaning of section 105(b)(3) of the Act.

In any potential investigation, TTB will look in part to determine if shelf plans or schematics are being provided as mere recommendations (authorized under the subpart D exceptions) or the de facto ultimate plan adopted by the retailer as a result of a unique relationship between it and the submitting industry member.  In the latter scenario, TTB may argue the submitting industry member’s schematic does not qualify for the section 6.99(b) exception.

#### SSQ6: In TTB Ruling 2016-1, what does TTB mean by “\[h\]owever, as revealed by TTB’s review of industry practices, some industry members do not offer a mere shelving plan alone but also include additional services, sometimes of significant value, that exceed the 27 CFR 6.99(b) exception’s plain language.”

During its review of industry practices, TTB found services being provided to retailers that are not specifically exempted under part 6, subpart D of the TTB regulations.  (27 CFR part 6, subpart D).  Industry members should read the Tied-House regulations to determine if the activities, services or items of value they furnish retailers are **specifically exempted** under subpart D.  If not **specifically exempted**, then such activities, services or items of value constitute inducements.

#### SSQ7: Are any of the five examples listed in TTB Ruling 2016-1 red light activities or are they all yellow light activities?

The terms “red light” and “yellow light” are neither used nor defined in the FAA Act or TTB’s Tied-House regulations.

The five examples of additional services (which are not all inclusive) described in TTB Ruling 2016-1 are not exempted by 27 CFR 6.99(b). Such services therefore constitute inducements within the meaning of section 105(b)(3) of the FAA Act.

In order to determine if the retailer’s independence is at risk, TTB would first determine if an inducement has been given to the retailer. It would then evaluate, in their entirety, all of the industry member’s practices/activities with the retailer and determine if they meet the requirements outlined in 27 CFR 6.152 (Practices which put retailer independence at risk) and/or 6.153 (Criteria for determining retailer independence).  TTB makes these determinations on a case-by-case basis.

A Federal Tied-House violation will exist if all of the elements of a violation are present.  This includes an industry member providing a retailer with a prohibited inducement that results in exclusion of competitor products, in whole or in part, such that the retailer’s independence is at risk, with the requisite connection to interstate or foreign commerce, and (in the case of malt beverages only) a similar State law.

#### SSQ8: In TTB Ruling 2016-1, how would TTB determine if an industry member is “\[a\]ssuming, in whole or in part, a retailer’s purchasing or pricing decisions, or shelf stocking decisions involving a competitor’s products”?

TTB will examine industry and retailer relationships on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the activity constitutes a proscribed inducement under 27 U.S.C. 205(b)(1) – (b)(7), as well as whether the activity places the retailer’s independence at risk according to the criteria listed in 27 CFR 6.152 and 6.153.  Whether an industry member’s activities place a retailer’s independence at risk is especially relevant when only one industry member prepares and submits schematics for a retailer.

#### SSQ9: Can an industry member receive and analyze confidential and/or proprietary competitor information on behalf of the retailer?

No subpart D exception authorizes analysis of retailer or competitor information (on behalf of the retailer) that is confidential/proprietary and not made available to all industry members on the same terms.  Accordingly, TTB considers such services a thing of value, and therefore an inducement, whether or not they ultimately result in furnishing a recommended schematic to the retailer.

- Example – Under a retailer-initiated program, competing industry members’ sales data, planned promotions, new products, or product pricing are shared with one industry member, which uses that information (in whole or in part) to create and provide the retailer with a recommended shelf plan.

- Example – Under an industry member-initiated program, retailer information (such as confidential retailer sales goals and expectations or retailer proprietary sales data) is shared with only one industry member, which uses such data (in whole or in part) to create and provide the retailer with a recommended shelf plan.

#### SSQ10: Can an industry member furnish retailers with items of value, including market data from third party vendors?

While TTB realizes industry members often purchase and use third-party market data to assist their creation of a recommended schematic, there is no subpart D exception that authorizes sharing with or giving to retailers such information in any format other than the ultimate shelf schematic recommended by the industry member.  It is up to the retailer (and not the industry member) to obtain and analyze any data that potentially supports or refutes the utility of a recommended schematic it receives.

Moreover, because there is also no subpart D exception authorizing industry members to purchase third-party market data from a company that is owned or controlled by the retailer, industry members doing so risk being deemed to have indirectly (and unlawfully) induced the retailer’s future purchases to the exclusion of its competitors.

#### SSQ11: Can an industry member provide follow-up services (such as communicating with the retailer’s stores, vendors, representatives, wholesalers, and suppliers concerning daily operational matters such as store resets, add and delete item lists, advertisements and promotions) in order to monitor and revise a schematic?

There is no subpart D exception authorizing industry members to monitor (or assist in monitoring) the retailer’s compliance with a shelf plan on behalf of a retailer.

#### SSQ12: Can an industry member furnish a retailer with human resources to perform functions/activities other than stocking, rotation or pricing the industry member’s own product, as permitted in § 6.99(a) of the TTB regulations?

If an industry member furnishes human resources to perform any function on behalf of the retailer that is not specifically exempted by the Tied-House regulations, such services constitute an inducement.  Industry members should carefully read the Tied-House regulations and determine if any contemplated activities, services or items of value are specifically exempted under subpart D.  If not specifically exempted then the activities, services or items of value constitute inducements.  If such practice results in exclusion of competitor products, in whole or in part, such that the retailer’s independence is at risk, with the requisite connection to interstate or foreign commerce, and if (in the case of malt beverages only) there is a similar State law, the practice would violate the FAA Act.

### Natural Disasters

#### NDQ1: I lost a significant quantity of wine at my bonded premises as a result of a natural disaster. Am I required to report my losses to TTB?

Yes. TTB regulations at [27 CFR 24.268 (link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=0453724ba4495691a00478ce678a2365&node=se27.1.24_1268&rgn=div8) require that proprietors report any casualty loss immediately to TTB. However, depending on the circumstances of the natural disaster, TTB may extend the deadline on a case-by-case basis.   Proprietors should report their losses as soon as they are able to determine the extent of the damage to their inventories. In their submissions, proprietors should provide the following information:

- Name and address of the bonded wine premises
- Registry number of the bonded wine premises ("BWN/BWC/BW-State-xxxxx")
- Kind of wine
- Alcohol content
- Approximate volume in gallons
- Date of loss
- Reason for loss (i.e., fire damage)
- Printed name of winery representative
- Signature (Person signing must have signing authority)
- Telephone number

This information should be submitted, either in letter form or as a fax, to TTB's National Revenue Center:

550 Main Street, Room 8970

Cincinnati, OH 45202-3222

Toll-free: 877-882-3277

Fax: 202-453-2338

The volume of wine lost must also be reported on [TTB F 5120.17, Report of Wine Premises Operations](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1264), for the reporting period during which the loss occurred.

#### NDQ2: What records should I keep of any spillage and breakage that occurred on my winery premises as a result of a natural disaster?

You should document the volume and tax class of wine lost in all appropriate TTB-required records - for example, the bulk still wine record (see [27 CFR 24.301(link is external)](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-27/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-24/subpart-O/section-24.301)) and the bottled or packed wine record (see [27 CFR 24.308(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=fdad319d893f703ce4668b1b62725eb9&node=se27.1.24_1308&rgn=div8)). Additionally, you must report the loss on your next [TTB F 5120.17, Report of Wine Premises Operations](https://www.ttb.gov/node/1264). The volume of bulk wine lost should be reported on line 29 of Part 1, Section A; the volume of bottled wine lost should be reported on line 18 of Part 1, Section B.

#### NDQ3: I need to destroy untaxpaid wine and/or wine spirits that were damaged during a natural disaster. What TTB procedures do I need to follow?

The destruction of wine is provided for in [27 CFR 24.294(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8ec407ef38bcba4a505fac97cd525d74&node=se27.1.24_1294&rgn=div8), which requires that a proprietor first request permission from TTB's National Revenue Center to destroy the lot of wine before proceeding with the destruction.  Depending on the circumstances of the natural disaster, TTB may waive the requirement that proprietors must first obtain TTB approval before destroying the wine.  However, proprietors must still submit a notification, as soon as practical, to the NRC containing the information required by [27 CFR 24.294(link is external)](http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=8ec407ef38bcba4a505fac97cd525d74&node=se27.1.24_1294&rgn=div8).

#### NDQ4: We removed this FAQ because it was out-of-date.

No results.

#### NDQ5: I'm a retailer, and I lost wine, beer, distilled spirits, and tobacco products as a result of a natural disaster. May I file a claim with TTB for a refund of the federal excise tax paid on all these products? My wholesale distributors have the same question.

Yes, retailers, wholesalers, and importers of beverage alcohol products and importers of tobacco products may file claims with TTB for a refund of the federal excise taxes paid on any beverage alcohol or tobacco products that were lost as a result of natural disasters, including hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and wildfires. However, retailers and wholesalers of tobacco products may only file a claim if the loss occurs as the result of a presidentially declared major disaster. To determine if a Presidential declaration of a major disaster has been made, please visit [Disaster Declarations at FEMA.gov(link is external)](https://www.fema.gov/disasters). For detailed information on how to file a claim, please visit [Disaster Relief](https://www.ttb.gov/nrc/disaster-relief) at TTB.gov.

#### NDQ6: I've heard that if I'm late filing for or paying my federal excise taxes due to a natural disaster, TTB will consider waiving the late penalties and interest. How can I qualify for this waiver?

TTB will consider waiving late filing, payment, or deposit penalties on a case-by-case basis. Wherever warranted, waivers will be approved based on the statutory standard of reasonable cause and a lack of willful neglect demonstrated by the taxpayer.

To qualify for such a waiver, a taxpayer must:

- Demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the TTB National Revenue Center (NRC), that wildfires directly affected your ability to timely file, pay, or deposit; and
